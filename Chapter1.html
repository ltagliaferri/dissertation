class="c15"><div><p class="c6 c16"><span></span></p></div><p class="c1"><span>Born in 1347 of a wool-dyer father, Caterina di Iacopo di Benincasa chose a religious life against her family&rsquo;s wishes. At 6 years of age, she had her first mystical vision of Christ, at 7 she made a vow of perpetual virginity to God, and at 21, she married Christ in a vision during which she received a ruby ring visible only to herself. In the years leading to her mystical marriage, she diligently practiced asceticism, which Suzanne Noffke describes as &ldquo;silent solitude&rdquo; and &ldquo;cozy isolationism&rdquo; (65). In her youth and adolescence, Catherine was largely private, occupying a small room in her father&rsquo;s house, while practicing daily flagellations and extreme fasting. Because of the severity of her actions, and their affects on her health, Raymond tells his readers that her family required her to keep her door ajar (V, 52). As she had decided early in life to dedicate herself to God, Catherine had initially followed a traditional approach typical of hermitage and cloistering of oneself, a popular form of spirituality through the Middle Ages. Indeed, the 13th and 14th centuries found fertile ground for religious expression in the urban centers of Italy &mdash; especially in Siena &mdash; with male and particularly female recluses well supported by the city, and visible to society (in the year of Catherine&rsquo;s birth, 80% of Siena&rsquo;s recluses were women) (</span><span>Thurber</span><span>&nbsp;47). By the second half of the 14th century, urban reclusion, which existed on the boundaries of cities and the boundaries of institutionalized religion, began to decline, while the third order vocations were increasingly considered to be more appropriate channels for female lay religious expression (Thurber 72). Although Catherine had at first seemed content in her reclusive life, she was eventually compelled by God to lead a public life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>While Catherine certainly spent her early years as an ascetic, her transition to communal space seems to have been grounded in her experiences. In her youth, she was attracted to the travelling Dominican preachers (Order of Friars Preachers) who came through Siena, and, as Raymond explains, Catherine so esteemed these Dominican friars that she longed to enter their Order to help guide people in spiritual matters. However, Catherine realized that her status as a woman would prevent her from joining them, leading her to consider following Saint Euphrosyne&rsquo;s model to pass herself as a man (III, 38). As Carolyn Muessig notes, Catherine would eventually prove to be an </span><span>&ldquo;itinerant peacemaker, papal representative of sorts, spiritual counselor, theologian, and tireless letter writer&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;(4). And Raymond himself writes that &ldquo;her life was to follow lines far different from those of other women,&rdquo; as God sent her to live among people, working for others in public places (XII, 116). However, it was through communities of civic-minded and spiritual women that Catherine learned and flourished, and throughout her life she served as a community-builder and advocate to both secular and religious, regardless of gender. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Catherine joined the </span><span class="c0">Mantellate</span><span>, a tertiary order of the Dominicans consisting of mostly widowed and married laywomen, when she was about 18 years old. The women at first did not want to accept her, as her status as a virgin was not typical of the order, but she was persistent and persuasive, as she would also prove to be in her subsequent political affairs. When Catherine first joined, she was still committed to prayer and solitude, but her work for the ill as a </span><span class="c0">mantellata</span><span>&nbsp;may have contributed in compelling her to leave her private space. The </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span>&nbsp;were dedicated to caring for the ill and doing good, and it was in hospitals that these group of women gathered, the center of which in Siena was the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala, near the Duomo. As Jane Tylus notes, the hospital &ldquo;...represented an intermediary space between public and private ... for the layperson dedicated to acts of mercy&rdquo; (68). Because of Siena&rsquo;s location on the Via Francigena, the ancient pilgrimage route to Rome, the </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span>&nbsp;cared not only for their geographical neighbors but also for many visitors. Thus, Catherine&rsquo;s position as a lay Dominican proved to be beneficial though her initial desire to be in the </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span>&nbsp;may have seemed contradictory. With this status, she had access to larger circles of people through her affiliation with the Dominicans and was able to engage with people of the world by living outside of a monastery, not unlike her Italian predecessor, Francis of Assisi.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>In 1374, Catherine first travels to Florence, and she spends most of 1375 in Pisa, where she gained greater public status. While she had started constructing herself as a public figure in Siena, she generated excitement during her extended stay in Pisa and established herself as a public preacher and miracle worker (Capecelatro 107, Tylus 134). It is from Pisa that Catherine begins to engage in intense and frequent letter-writing, often addressing her spiritual and blood </span><span class="c0">famiglia</span><span>&nbsp;in Siena. In 1376 she travels to Avignon and is credited with the pope&rsquo;s return to Rome in September of that year, proving herself as someone engaged in politics. Still, as a woman in the public sphere, she was accused of vainglory, which Raymond sought to defend throughout the last chapter of his </span><span class="c0">Legenda</span><span>. As one may expect, this is a gendered issue, as Raymond notes her critics claimed, &ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a woman. Why doesn&rsquo;t she stay in her cell, if it&rsquo;s God she wants to serve?&rsquo;&rdquo; (IV, 365). Raymond writes that both men and women are accusatory, and he uses examples from her fellow </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span>, instead proving her sanctity by describing her steadfastness and commitment to the public work of God. In this manner, Raymond is quick to disband Catherine from the urban communities that she is actively involved with, asserting her as a solitary holy figure. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>However, according to the anonymously authored </span><span class="c0">Miracoli di Caterina di Iacopo da Siena</span><span>, Catherine read aloud to her fellow </span><span class="c0">Mantellate</span><span>&nbsp;at supper time, which Tylus notes &ldquo;situates Catherine in a world of women who, far from spreading snide words about her imagined sanctity, are listening to her read...&rdquo; (127). Meanwhile, Raymond&rsquo;s own </span><span class="c0">Legenda major</span><span>, Caffarini&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">Leggenda minore </span><span>and </span><span class="c0">Processo Castellano</span><span>, Stefano Maconi&rsquo;s and the Pope&rsquo;s letters &mdash; to name a few &mdash; are all indicative of Catherine&rsquo;s participation not just in a female community but an active interlocutor of the male religious community as well. Her letters on practical matters (to a prostitute, different classes </span><span>[...])</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" name="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span>, political leaders (</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>) and concerning the justice system (T273) reveal her participation in wider civic society. Therefore, Catherine of Siena is not a mystic bound by her interiority and other-worldliness, but rather an active force in this world &mdash; her contemporary Italy &mdash; and a remarkable human who can operate outside and within societal constructs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>In this chapter, I will explore the special situation of the mystic, Catherine&rsquo;s own self-construction through her words and through her work, and how she was represented by others to lead to her canonization in 1461.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11">The figure/situation of the mystic</span></p><p class="c1"><span>A year before his death, Sigmund Freud writes a single sentence in an entry dated August 22, 1938: &ldquo;Mysticism is the obscure self-perception of the realm outside the ego, of the </span><span>id</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" name="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Mystik de dunkle Selbstwahrehmung des Reiches ausserhalb des Ichs, des Es&rdquo;). Though Freud wrote on mysticism throughout his life, he did not view it as a means to religious redemption, but seemed to couple it more with psychoanalysis itself, as a way to know that which exists outside of the ego, in direct contact with the id.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" name="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In general, Freud sees mysticism as irrational and in lack of an organizing language, while still probing at an intellectual problem that cannot be grasped by the rational self. Though many theorists will agree with its irrationality and further identify the mystic as a pathological figure, others view mysticism to be a domain into which a specific language is explored and brought to light, beyond the boundaries of learned and self-conscious speech and writing. For feminist theorists, the language is largely charged with amorous expression due to mysticism being intrinsically joined with femininity and a state of loving. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In </span><span class="c0">The Second Sex</span><span>, Simone de Beauvoir characterizes the mystic as a lover </span><span>desirous of </span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" name="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span>Christ, associated with blood and self-annihilation, and ostensibly a woman. As part of Beauvoir&rsquo;s argument throughout the broader text, love is assigned to woman as her supreme vocation &mdash; that is, she is defined by the loving she does. When a woman loves a man, Beauvoir explains, she is seeking God in this man. Man is the representation of God (or the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span>), and as Lacan further demonstrates, &ldquo;</span><span>The phallus is the signifier of signifiers, the privileged signifier of that mark in which the role of the logos is joined with the advent of desire</span><span>&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0">E&#769;crits</span><span>&nbsp;287). For man, reason and desire and the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span>&nbsp;are conflated, but as woman is without the phallus, she is relegated to the lover, only capable of desiring the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span>, typically in the form of a man. If, Beauvoir writes, human love is denied to her &mdash; whether due to her having been disappointed in love, or her having been too selective in choosing a lover &mdash; she may seek the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span>&nbsp;in the person of God himself. Interestingly, by choosing to direct herself to God, the female mystic is superseding the intermediary force of the male human and is encountering the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span>&nbsp;unimpeded, desiring this true signifier of signifiers rather than the corporeal representation of God found in man. The female mystic using love (even desirous love) as a vehicle toward desiring and comprehending the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span>&nbsp;is exactly in line with Christian theology, as </span><span>Dante</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" name="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt5" name="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt6" name="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;so aptly illustrates in erotic language throughout </span><span class="c0">Paradiso</span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" name="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;by borrowing from the eroticism inherent in the biblical Song of Songs and hagiographies (e.g., St. Francis marrying Poverty). The blending of </span><span class="c0">caritas</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">eros</span><span>&nbsp;as a method for approaching the divine and thus the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span>&nbsp;or God is a legitimate expression of faith that simultaneously disrupts psychoanalytic gendering of women through their channeling of desirous love to encounter the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span>&nbsp;unmediated by masculine </span><span class="c0">accoutrements</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Much of the tension surrounding the mystic in theoretical inquiry pivots around the perception of the mystic as an hysterical figure. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cixous views the mystic as being aligned with hysteria rather than religiosity &mdash; a non-mystical religious woman, for Cixous, is an obsessive-compulsive, whereas an hysterical woman is an artist and revolutionary. In general, and as Amy Hollywood notes, theorists typically denigrate the affective and expressive embodiments of mysticism, though the rare exceptions (Bataille, Beauvoir, Lacan, Irigaray) view these women less pathologically and instead as subversive figures who can effectively merge action and contemplation, emotion and reason, body and soul. Teresa of Avila and Angela of Foligno are discussed in particular, and Beauvoir writes on Joan of Arc and Catherine of Siena as well. In her own texts, Catherine adroitly blends the active with the contemplative, emphasizing her act of doing good works in the world as part of her spirituality. </span><span>In </span><span class="c0">Possible Lives: Authors and Saints in Renaissance Italy</span><span>, </span><span>Alison Knowles Frazier</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>discusses</span><span>&nbsp;how what is emphasized in Renaissance hagiography shifts from an other-worldly spirituality to a this-worldly spirituality, focused on a male </span><span class="c0">vita activa</span><span>&nbsp;and reforming manifestations of religious life outside the cloister and in the city. Figures like St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Ambrose, St. Potitus and St. Nicholas are profiled in particular, and the Latin humanist writers generally prefer the male subject to the female, with about 5% of Dominican accounts and 25% of Franciscan accounts being about women (Frazier 35). </span></p><p class="c1"><span>With a shift toward the active life in narratives of male religious, we cannot say that the blending of action with contemplation is entirely the domain of the female mystic. In fact, many women in the medieval and early modern periods would have been entirely precluded from having a &ldquo;this-worldly&rdquo; active life whether religious or not. Aristotle develops the crucial distinctions between </span><span class="c0">zoe </span><span>and </span><span class="c0">bios</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">oikos </span><span>and </span><span class="c0">polis</span><span>, limiting women to the realms of </span><span class="c0">zoe </span><span>(the biological life outside of politics) and </span><span class="c0">oikos </span><span>(the home), whereas men inhabit the domains of </span><span class="c0">bios</span><span>&nbsp;(the qualified life, the life of society, and political life) and </span><span class="c0">polis</span><span>&nbsp;(the city). Though there are some women who are societally sanctioned to engage in public life &mdash; like Mary Magdalene, Joan of Arc, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Vittoria Colonna &mdash; the vast majority of women through the Renaissance were unable to participate in the political life of the city, including those who claimed to have a higher divine impetus for doing so. In </span><span class="c0">Women of the Renaissance</span><span>, Margaret King notes that between the years of 1300 and 1700 &ldquo;witches&rdquo; in Italy outnumbered religious women 100 to 1, revealing that women who attempted to be viewed as religious and spread the word about their sanctity were much more frequently viewed to be demonic, an accusation that Catherine herself had even endured by some skeptics, though she is distinguished as a Church Doctor today (145). Even earlier female mystics like </span><span>Hildegard </span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" name="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><span>of Bingen lead remarkable lives pursuing multivalent approaches to knowledge production and creative works, yet were proscribed from a public life outside the cloister apart from their letter writing endeavors. Though letter writing could be interpreted to be a subversive form of political engagement, and continues to be an important method of communication for later mystics and Catherine of Siena in particular, there is still a lack of public presence and public voice. Famously, a portion of Hildegard&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">Scivias</span><span>&nbsp;were read aloud by Pope Eugenius III to assembled clergy, revealing how even a medieval woman&rsquo;s writing could participate in public performance, though the female voice of the writer is left unheard (</span><span>Logan 175</span><span>). </span></p><p class="c1"><span>The mystic or even religious woman is othered twice: first she is an outsider contained within </span><span class="c0">zoe</span><span>, secondly she is an outsider for being something that is &ldquo;sacred.&rdquo; In Roman law, the </span><span class="c0">homo sacer</span><span>&nbsp;is one who cannot be sacrificed yet can be killed without the killer being condemned for homicide &mdash; those that are sacred belonging to the class of those who exist outside of society (Agamben 47). Priests, hermits, the sacrificial and the gods all exist outside of </span><span class="c0">bios</span><span>, outside of society and in a state of exclusion. Yet, all except God(s) are in some ways included in the form of exclusion &mdash; what Agamben describes as &ldquo;the ambiguity of the sacred&rdquo; &mdash; these sacred men are in some ways within and some ways without (50). Ambiguity consistently lies within the construction of the sacred, with overlapping between the holy and the unclean, for instance, which is an even more historically difficult line for women to negotiate. This being because the </span><span class="c0">femina sacra</span><span>, doubly without political life, is rendered twice removed. The &ldquo;witches&rdquo; killed throughout history for being part of this </span><span class="c0">femina sacra</span><span>&nbsp;classification suffered due to their twice-othered status, yet without any ramifications for those who killed them &mdash; in most cases the state. Though some very few women were fortunate enough to successfully escape death by the state, this may have been due to their amplified outsider status. As sacred women, they were completely outside the world of man, just like God,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" name="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and were therefore closer to the word of God, viewed more often as a conduit for God&rsquo;s word in their mystical writing, than as a mediatrix channeling the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>As men were typically able to to express their religious authority through learning, citation, rhetoric and public engagement, they were not limited to the &ldquo;prophetic, visionary, or mystical claims [that] were the primary modes of religious authorization available to women&rdquo; (</span><span>Hollywood</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Gender, Agency&rdquo; 514). On the figure of the male mystic, Lacan writes, &ldquo;There are men who are just as good as women. It does happen. Despite, I won&rsquo;t say their phallus, despite what encumbers them on that score, they get the idea, they sense there must be a </span><span class="c0">jouissance</span><span>&nbsp;which goes beyond. That is what we call a mystic&rdquo; (&ldquo;God and the </span><span class="c0">Jouissance</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;147</span><span>&nbsp;/ </span><span>S XX p. 76). Here, Lacan ties mysticism to bodily experience that is a painful pleasure (for him, beyond the phallus), an eroticism that could be said to be described frequently in mystical writing. Though corporality and perceived sexual difference are subjects touched upon by mystics, along with images of sensually felt divine love, there is also at play a complication of gender throughout many mystical and religious texts that suggest that there is an aspect of mysticism that goes beyond not just </span><span class="c0">jouissance</span><span>&nbsp;but also beyond a dichotomic gender binary. As Anne J. Cruz writes, &ldquo;female mystics verbalize a uniquely Christocentric position that both transgresses and transcends gender order,&rdquo; and I would add this to mystics in general, not just that male mystics participate in </span><span class="c0">jouissance</span><span>, but are equally inhabiting a complicated space that is both pushing at the boundaries and beyond the construction of </span><span>gender</span><sup><a href="#cmnt9" name="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;(134).</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Running parallel yet divergent to the other creation stories of Genesis, the book of the generations of Adam, Genesis 5, reads, &ldquo;In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created&rdquo; (1-2). That is, from the beginning, male and female are part of Adam, and are also, presumably, part of God, as Adam is created in God&rsquo;s image. This rings remarkably similar to Aristophanes&rsquo;s creation tale of the three sexes as described in Plato&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">Republic</span><span>, except that in Genesis 5 there is only one sex comprised of both male and female identity. Perhaps, like the four-legged androgyne of Aristophanes, the female part of Adam was excised to form Eve, and we have since inherited a double-sexed notion of gender which was largely enforced in the Middle Ages and early modern period. Yet, from these early religious texts, there is enough scope for two genders to exist in one body, suggesting a complication of gender from the very creation stories that propagate the Judeo-Christian tradition. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>From a linguistic perspective, the situation of the soul is decidedly feminine as the Latin word &ldquo;anima&rdquo; is a feminine word. Thus, mystical writers like Jerome, Gregory of Nyssa, Thomas Aquinas (in </span><span class="c0">Summa theologica </span><span>as well as </span><span class="c0">De anima</span><span>) and Bernard of Clairvaux view the soul as intrinsically feminine. For those writing in the vernacular, Meister Eckhart uses the German feminine noun &ldquo;Seele,&rdquo; and Catherine and Teresa of Avila will adopt the feminine &ldquo;a/&aacute;nima&rdquo; in their native Italian and Spanish, respectively. Though linguistic gender may not seem particularly remarkable, it is worth noting that Bonaventure opts for the Latin masculine word &ldquo;mens&rdquo; (mind) rather than &ldquo;anima,&rdquo; and that Bernard of Clairvaux speaks of himself and his fellow monks in feminine terms throughout his writing, perhaps informed by the gendered language in addition to the hierarchical position of the worshipper who approaches the divine (</span><span>Harmles</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;49, 85). Indeed, Bernard&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">Sermons on the </span><span class="c0">Song of Songs</span><sup><a href="#cmnt10" name="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>speak to the malleability of the reader&rsquo;s gender, as the presumably male reader must place himself in the position of the presumably female bride &mdash; allegorically the Church &mdash; to the presumably male bridegroom of Christ.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" name="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In this text, he describes being kissed on the mouth by Christ, and remarks on his female corporeality including breasts that swell with milk (</span><span>2.2, 9.2, 9.7</span><sup><a href="#cmnt11" name="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup><span>).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" name="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span>Famously, Bernard is also tied to breast </span><span>milk</span><span>&nbsp;due to his mystical vision known as </span><span class="c0">Lactatio Bernardi</span><span>&nbsp;in which the Virgin Mary intervenes on his behalf, perhaps to cure an eye </span><span>infection</span><span>, by either shooting her milk into his eyes, or dripping it into his mouth. In his chapter on &ldquo;Bernard and Mary&rsquo;s Milk,&rdquo; Brian Patrick McGuire details a number of stories and visual art treatments that center around Bernard or another unnamed monk from Clairvaux, and James France notes that Bernard was not the only non-Christ figure suckling Mary&rsquo;s milk as this became a &ldquo;widespread theme in collections of Marian miracle stories&rdquo; (McGuire 189-225, France </span><span>329</span><span>). Interestingly, the monk is not only cured or aided, but also learns to be a great preacher through the milk,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" name="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and in one 13th-century source the holy fluid allowed the monk to obtain a &ldquo;knowledge of letters.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" name="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Here, the Virgin is regarded as a divine figure, not a mediatrix who intervenes on the male worshipper&rsquo;s behalf to attain grace from the masculine divinity of the Father or the Son, and is able to also foster traditionally male knowledge of preaching and letters in the monk she blesses with her breast milk. This is certainly in line with the Cult of the Virgin popular through the Middle Ages and still arguably pursued in present-day Catholic tradition (especially in Latin America and the Philippines) which allowed for the persisted worship of the pre-Christian Earth Mother.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" name="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;What is significant is that the Virgin, despite her status as mother and thus conscribed in a female body, still cultivates divine agency, which may be perceived to belong only to a masculine domain. The Virgin, having become pregnant and birthing a child miraculously, as well as being the only human after Christ&rsquo;s death to have not suffered a bodily death,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" name="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;reveals how the feminine can fit into the conception of the divine without becoming masculinized in some way. In her essay &ldquo;Stabat Mater,&rdquo; Julia Kristeva asks, &ldquo;If it is not possible to say of a </span><span class="c0">woman</span><span>&nbsp;that she </span><span class="c0">is</span><span>..., would it perhaps be different concerning the </span><span class="c0">mother</span><span>, since that is the only function of the &lsquo;other sex&rsquo; to which we can definitely attribute existence?&rdquo; (161). If not knowing man sexually, as Eve did, somehow precludes her from some construct of the feminine, then the expression of motherhood with its pregnancy and bodily nourishment of the infant must call her back into that domain. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>That domain of motherhood, however, is not reserved for women. Christ is frequently a nurturer, who literally provides sustenance to his followers through his body and blood via transubstantiation during every Catholic mass. If one were to argue that corporeality and nourishing were exclusive to a feminine expression of spirituality, in Christ exists the clear exception. Caroline Walker Bynum discusses the parallelism between the Virgin&rsquo;s breast and Christ&rsquo;s wound, compellingly arguing the significance of the art historical record that positions Christ&rsquo;s wound close to the breast is purposeful and telling.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" name="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Like Mary, too, and noted by Augustine, he is positioned as &ldquo;Mediator of God and humanity, the man Jesus Christ,&rdquo; existing simultaneously in the earthly and spiritual realms (1 Tim 2:5).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" name="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;As the virgin son of God and woman, Christ is without a flesh and blood direct male ancestor, rendering him to be something of a gender outsider.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt11" name="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;We must keep in mind that historically, blood has at times been gendered, as James White notes, &ldquo;In medieval medical theory, blood was understood as the precursor to all other bodily fluids, including sperm and breast milk,&rdquo; thus when Catherine equates the fragrance of her blood to that of Niccol&ograve; di Toldo, she is suggesting that her blood is masculine rather than feminine (167). And for Christ, the opposite may well be true, as his human bloodlines are feminine, and as his blood is used in the production of a nourishing liquid. Catherine also constructs a &ldquo;female Christ,&rdquo; as F. Thomas Luongo has argued with regard to the language of Letter T273 that seems to reverse the traditional understanding of the Song of Songs, with Christ as the &ldquo;sweet bride&rdquo; who receives the masculine bridegroom soul in penetrative language (&ldquo;Catherine of Siena: Rewriting the Female Holy Authority&rdquo; 95-97). Christ is in many ways tied to nourishing and motherhood and though he can be complicated as a feminine figure, he is still often cast as masculine and thus decidedly outside of the traditional realm inhabited by female. Roland Barthes suggests a new conception of the maternal: &ldquo;Perhaps one should end up with this: ... no longer automatically confusing mother and woman. In which case, the androgyne would be any subject within whom there is something maternal&rdquo; (</span><span>194</span><sup><a href="#cmnt12" name="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup><span>). It is therefore necessary to claim the maternal as outside of woman, and fitting with a shifting, inconstant or outlying gender identification.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>In Kristeva&rsquo;s essay on the Virgin, she evokes not only milk but also tears as a non-verbal semiotics (174). While the milk is the symbol of nourishment, the mother&rsquo;s tears are an expression of a sorrowful humanity; as a mother one is the symbol of life who also functions as the veil of inevitable death. However, again, it is not only women and mothers who cry &mdash; Abraham weeps out of mourning for Sarah in Genesis 23:2, David weeps occasionally in the Books of Samuel, Christ weeps in John 11:35 and Hebrews 5:7, Peter weeps bitterly after denying Christ in Matthew 26:75, Gregory the Great introduced the phrase &ldquo;lacrymarum gratia&rdquo; in his 6th-century </span><span class="c0">Dialogues</span><span>, tears were an important aspect of medieval monastic life for men,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12" name="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and hagiographical records of Francis of Assisi note that his copious tears contributed to his eventually becoming blind. Arguably, each of these cases of tears are expressing sorrowful humanity, and are also spiritual utterances that are not constrained by corporeal states of sex, sexuality, or gender. The tears of men may not cause one to question their masculinity, but they do complicate the gendering of these emotional performances as </span><span>ipso facto</span><sup><a href="#cmnt13" name="cmnt_ref13">[m]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;feminine. Kristeva&rsquo;s nonvocal semiotics of the mother can be extended to be part of a mystical semiotics that exist outside of speech and written word (as in Francis&rsquo;s case), but should not be limited in its conscription to the domain of womanhood, as mothering and its expressions are not bound to a singular gender.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The figure of the virgin, who is determinedly outside of sexuality, and typically does not participate in the expression of motherhood as in Kristeva&rsquo;s discussion of Mary, is even less easily gendered. Though in her </span><span class="c0">Scivias</span><span>, Hildegard puts forth that married sexual life can be a fine choice for a Christian when done with care, the corporeal state of virginity would always be preferable. Throughout her writing, she conflates &ldquo;virginitas&rdquo; with &ldquo;viriditas&rdquo; (greenness) and &ldquo;virilitas&rdquo; (virility) &mdash; for Hildegard and her contemporaries, words were valid signifiers for that which they signified. Thus, the virgin is a green and ripening fruit that pulls its power from the sun, rendering greenness to be a vital force that can be easily reconciled with the notion of virility. With these similarities in mind, both male and female &ldquo;green&rdquo; virgins prove to be not only virile, but the most virile of humans as virginity has more viridity integral to it than any other state of being. Indeed, in her </span><span class="c0">Symphonia</span><span>, Hildegard refers to the Virgin Mary as &ldquo;viridissima virga&rdquo; (no. 19) and Saint Rupert of Bingen as &ldquo;dulcis viriditas pomis&rdquo; (no. 49, 4a), while also emphasizing his position as a &ldquo;vas nobile / quod non est pollutum&rdquo; (no. 49, 4b). Though Maud Burnett McInerney argues that Hildegard represents Rupert through a &ldquo;feminization of his body,&rdquo; it seems to me that Hildegard is actually working to position the virgin within a separate class in and of itself (</span><span>149</span><span>). That is, the greenness that Hildegard describes is not in some way aligned with femininity, or even masculinity despite its connection to virility, but exists as an especially virile condition that is amplified for having been taken out of a sexual economy and gender. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>The figures of the mystic as well as the saint, whether virgin or not, are also in many ways beyond gender, just as they remain as individuals outside of the political life of society. With all of the recasting of gender in Song of Songs by religious thinkers, it is interesting to consider that in the </span><span class="c0">Legenda aurea</span><span>, Jacobus de Voragine describes Saint Sebastian as the saddle in between Christ-the-horseman and Church-the-horse. Though Sebastian has recently become an iconic saint for the LGBTQ community due to frequent homoerotic paintings of his martyrdom throughout art history,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt13" name="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Voragine was likely not consciously depicting Sebastian as inhabiting a third gender between the presumably masculine Christ and presumably feminine Church, though the imagery is decidedly sexual. Not only does Voragine evoke the Song of Songs, but horseback riding as well, which was typically understood to be a metaphor for sexual relations throughout the medieval period.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt14" name="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In occupying the space between the masculine and the feminine, as the saddle between horse and rider, Sebastian can skillfully negotiate both spaces, or else be entirely outside either. Famously penetrated by all those arrows as one of his trials of martyrdom, Sebastian can occupy the positionality of the sexual female, while simultaneously holding military rank, which was traditionally reserved for the masculine domain. Though not described as a mystic, throughout his saintly life, Sebastian exemplifies the complicated gendering of the religious figure, which is even more problematized with the religious figure is also engaging with mysticism. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Mystics in particular reject many of the traditional and typically masculine forms of Christian worship: the desert fathers and mothers rejected all societal and gendered context by separating themselves from it, cloistered and anchorite mystics separated themselves from society at large and the gender binary more specifically, and itinerant mystics like Catherine chose to live unconventional lives that were unattached to norms imposed by gender roles. As </span><span>Bonaventure</span><span>&nbsp;writes, the Franciscans prayed not on ecclesiastical books and did not chant the canonical hours, but prayed humbly to the Cross of Christ and on all things, suggesting that they were not interested in praying in a learned and erudite manner (which would have been limited to male Christians at the time) (IV, 3). Further, Bonaventure explains how the Franciscans believed that to achieve grace, one should renounce the wisdom of the world as well as his knowledge of letters, and thus dispossessed of such inheritance to go naked to the Lord (VII, 2). This teaching, which is certainly in keeping with Francis&rsquo;s own biographical experience of renouncing his earthly possessions and law profession by rendering himself naked in a piazza of Assisi,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt15" name="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;rings true for all mystics &mdash; without the accoutrements of clothing and societal performance, these figures are without gender, class or societal status, but a </span><span class="c0">homo sacer</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Many mystics &mdash; more than denying themselves clothes, educational capital, belongings, and manneristic performance &mdash; tried to deny themselves of their body as well. Though Caroline Walker Bynum and Rudolph M. Bell discuss the many holy women who denied themselves food,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt16" name="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and the fasting Catherine would also limit her sleep to half an hour out of every period of two days, bodily denial was not limited to feminine spiritual practices. Hair shirts and flagellation were typical expressions of corporeal mortification and suffering across gender, whether to prevent sexual urges or in an attempt to no longer feel the body at all. In addition to sleeping on hard surfaces and a diet devoid of meat and cooked vegetables, in one hagiographic episode, Francis flees to the cold snow outside to dispel his desires. Writing on Spanish mystics including Juan de los &Aacute;ngeles and John of the Cross, Maureen Flynn explains how negating the temporally-bound body proved to be a means to fully incorporate the soul more purely with God, allowing the individual&rsquo;s core of the immortal soul to rid itself of sensory and mental faculties to transcend (&ldquo;The Spiritual Uses of Pain in Spanish Mysticism&rdquo;). This is to say, that even if we do not follow Judith Butler&rsquo;s view that sex is just as much of a construction as gender is, these practices show that not only are mystics divorcing themselves from gender but they are trying to remove themselves from their body as well: going naked to the Lord means ridding oneself not just of clothes but of the body as well. Mystics are working to exist on the Earth just as they eventually will in Paradise, as genderless, sexless, body-less immortal creatures of God. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Although religious and holy figures engage with many of the same negotiations of sex, gender, and social status that mystics do, the mystic is in a special situation due to </span><span>her</span><sup><a href="#cmnt14" name="cmnt_ref14">[n]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;direct access to God. As Helen Rolfson writes (128):</span></p><p class="c4 c17"><span>The mystic speaks of God as of the partner in dialogue. What is said about one is reflected mirror-wise in the other ... The prayers of Catherine of Siena beautifully demonstrate this reciprocity &hellip; As William of St. Thierry puts it: &ldquo;True friendship either finds or creates equals.&rdquo; No friendship is based on inequality. The mystic is very aware that that offer of divine friendship has been extended to one who is anything but God&rsquo;s equal. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Though the mystic does not perceive herself to be the equal to God, she sees herself to be a partner and a friend, which is a condition that approaches God unlike any other state of being. The unique relationship between mystic and God is often viewed as one in which the mystic serves as a conduit for God&rsquo;s word, but, as Rolfson explains, it proves to be more of a working and reciprocal partnership. </span><span>Therefore, conversations with God and the resulting writing that documents these dialogues act as another space in which the mystic acts to mediate. The mystic channels God&rsquo;s direct teaching, filters it through her experience and knowledge, and then releases it as a means to teach and nurture others. The language, as we will explore, is bound by earthly literary conventions and reveals the agency that the mystic has in her relationship to God&rsquo;s word. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a partnership, of course, is the union with God that all religious followers experience to some degree, but which mystics more palpably participate in, through mystical marriages and spiritual transpositions. Catherine of Siena marries Christ, exchanges her heart with his, relates how her name is interchanged with Christ&rsquo;s by Niccol&ograve; di Toldo,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" name="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and carries out God&rsquo;s work in public spaces throughout her life. She is not alone, as Catherine of Alexandria, Teresa of Avila, Rose of Lima, Francisco de Hoyos y </span><span>Sena</span><sup><a href="#cmnt15" name="cmnt_ref15">[o]</a></sup><span>, and many others also experienced a mystical wedding, and still more wrote prayers and sermons on marriage with Christ.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt18" name="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Similarly, others take the place of Christ in certain instances: the martyrs suffer and sacrifice themselves as Christ did, Bernard of Clairvaux drinks Mary&rsquo;s milk in the place of the infant Jesus, Margaret and other saints literally and allegorically beat the devil as God does in the Bible. Origen </span><span class="c0">adimantios</span><span>&nbsp;writes on the role of the soul as a mother to Jesus &ldquo;And every soul, virgin and uncorrupted, which conceives by the Holy Spirit, so as to give birth to the Will of the Father, is the Mother of Jesus,&rdquo; emphasizing the constantly in-flux relationships between Mary and Christ, the soul and Mary, and the soul and Christ (Comm. on Mt. frg. 281 [GCS Origen 12.1:126.10-15]).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt19" name="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In remarking particularly of a pure soul, that is virginal and uncorrupted, Origen is limiting his pool of Christian followers dramatically, and speaks to the complicated role of the Virgin Mary, and the concept of the virgin as a figure that is on the peripheries of gender and in conflict with itself in many ways &mdash; at once a virgin and a mother. Moreover, Teresa of &Aacute;vila notes in her writing that she lived only through God being within her,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt20" name="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;the missionary mystical writer Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza appropriates Christ&rsquo;s voice, and Angela de Foligno identified with Christ throughout her writing (Cruz 133-136). In many ways the mystic is not only married with God, but entrenched with him, and more often with the Son of God, Christ, specifically, exchanging body parts, voices, and positions with him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>The union with God, whether it is perceived as the result of a mystical marriage or not, leads to another positionality that is difficult to locate. Jacopone da Todi writes of the union with God as a loss of self, tempering it paradoxically with some semblance of maintained subjectivity on the part of the soul who is both conquering and conquered: &ldquo;The form that has been given you by God has absorbed you in such a way that you live although you are dead, both conqueror and conquered&rdquo; (Laud 91, as quoted in </span><span class="c0">The Flowering of Mysticism</span><span>&nbsp;130). </span><span>Hadewijch</span><sup><a href="#cmnt16" name="cmnt_ref16">[p]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;uses similar contradictory language of the union between the mortal soul and the divine in a letter (</span><span class="c0">Letter</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">IX</span><span>)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt21" name="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span>, </span></p><p class="c4 c17"><span>From the depths of his wisdom, he shall teach you what he is and with what wonderful sweetness the one lover lives in the other and so permeates the other that they do not know themselves from each other. But they possess each other in mutual delight, mouth in mouth, heart in heart, body in body, soul in soul, while a single divine nature flows through them both and they both become one through each other, yet remaining always themselves.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>In this description, there is a knowledge that is cultivated through the union &mdash; not a knowledge of letters (though one may gain that from Mary&rsquo;s breast milk), but a certain sweet and spiritual wisdom. Hadewijch blends imagery from the Song of Songs with more equitable ideas about marriage than what may have been available at the time of her writing: two lovers who are one yet maintain their own identity. Quoting William of St. Thierry, Bernard McGinn writes, &ldquo;The mystical life consists of an ongoing oscillation between [ ... ] two stages &mdash; &lsquo;...the man of God ought to be always either rational in seeking or spiritual in loving&rsquo;&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0">The Growth of Mysticism</span><span>&nbsp;235). The &ldquo;man&rdquo; of God is always finding himself in a fluctuating position, shifting between not just two stages of rationality (an earthly state) and spirituality, but constantly negotiating among many different registers that are coded as human, divine and other. Like the recluses of Siena in the 13th and 14th centuries, the mystic is on the peripheries of the city, at its edges like the </span><span class="c0">homo sacer</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystic is a borderless figure, gendered queer and an amalgamation between nature and divine, fluctuating between a this-worldly direction and an other-worldly focus. Like the Latin American figure of Santa Muerte, a skeleton saint who travels beyond borders with migrants who carry her and is considered to be at once folkloristic and holy, the mystics operate within a similar space: by being sacred they are othered. Nomadic, whether by being an earthly itinerant preacher or a dively transcendent anchorite, the mystic passes through borders freely yet is bound by them, and persists as a figure of tension that holds &ldquo;incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true,&rdquo; paradoxically shifting between rational language and erotically charged spiritual language, the sense of being nothing and everything at once in union with, yet separate from God (Haraway 161). In her &ldquo;Manifesto,&rdquo; Donna Haraway writes, &ldquo;Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment,&rdquo; and, moreover, the queer cybernetic mystic might consider the partial, fluid, and sometimes-state of mortality and immortality, human and non-human, within and without (180). In their transition of becoming something other-than-human beings, the mystic is also Rosi Braidotti&rsquo;s posthuman figure, deeply ambiguous and disembodied, experiencing apocalyptic anxieties yet seeking transcendence via martyrdom. A paradoxical figure, the mystic, like the texts that she leaves behind, operates within the periphery: between and among, folklore and canon, erudite and wise yet uneducated and sensing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Returning to Freud&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;Mysticism is the obscure self-perception of the realm outs</span><span>i</span><span>de the ego, of the id,&rdquo; and considering that the id also dominates psychological development prior to the phallic stage of sexual awareness and gender expression, it is possible to see how mystics are working outside of a sexual economy, outside of gender, and outside of typically human forms of consciousness. In her lyrical text, </span><span class="c0">Teresa, My Love</span><span>, on the mystic Teresa of &Agrave;vila, Kristeva really gets to the heart of the situation of the mystic (26):</span></p><p class="c4 c17"><span>Hail Teresa, borderless woman, &hellip; made word, made flesh, who unravels inside and outside herself, ... too much body yet disembodied, beyond matter, ... throbbing for the Beloved ever-present and yet never there, ... His in her, hers in Him, ... La Madre being the most virile of monks, most canny of the herders of souls, a veritable twin of Christ, she is He, He is she, the Truth is me, or Him in the deepest part of me, me Teresa&hellip;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The mystic is a conflation of so many seemingly contradictory yet in flux states of being. Despite these multivalent experiential states, there is an interest in self-construction among mystics that is beyond the constraints of society in general, and instead approaches a transcendent state of being that is yet still operating within temporal language and space. In this way, the mystic is within and without, straddling the border between the active and contemplative, the masculine and feminine, the earthly and the divine &mdash; and serving as a bridge that complicates these boundaries and fuses them together. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>&quot;cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism&quot; - Haraway</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Jacopone da Todi (ca. 1236-1306) </span></p><p class="c4"><span>&ldquo;You run and you stand still, you rise as you fall;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The more you give the more you receive:</span></p><p class="c4"><span>You possess the Creator.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>In being possessed you possess,</span></p><p class="c4"><span>In seamless union;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>As you drink you are being drunk &mdash;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Nothing can separate you</span></p><p class="c4"><span>From this perfection.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>There is no impediment,</span></p><p class="c4"><span>For he will no longer close His hand to you,</span></p><p class="c4"><span>To you, His Lady, His bride.&rdquo;(Jacopone </span><span>272-273</span><span>)</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://english.nd.edu/people/faculty/knoppers/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwtFcSrB5UUQChZbXdSKdm9hVy5g">http://english.nd.edu/people/faculty/knoppers/</a></span><span>&nbsp;- art as part of lit argument</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Quotes from Kristeva&rsquo;s Teresa My Love:</span></p><p class="c4"><span>&ldquo;Let Him kiss me with the kiss of His mouth .&hellip; I confess that the passage has many meanings. but the soul that is enkindled with a love that makes it mad [</span><span class="c0">que la desatina</span><span>] desires nothing else than to say those words &hellip;.
