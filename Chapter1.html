becoming &mdash; of Christ&rsquo;s flesh itself. &nbsp;/ In fact, Catherine clearly associated Christ&rsquo;s physicality with the female body, underlying thereby both her capacity for assimilation to

wool-dyer father, Caterina di Iacopo di Benincasa chose a religious life against her family&rsquo;s wishes. At 6 years of age, she had her first mystical vision of Christ, at 7 she made a vow of perpetual virginity to God, and at 21, she married Christ in a vision during which she received a ruby ring visible only to herself. In the years leading to her mystical marriage, she diligently practiced asceticism, which Suzanne Noffke describes as &ldquo;silent solitude&rdquo; and &ldquo;cozy isolationism&rdquo; (65). In her youth and adolescence, Catherine was largely private, occupying a small room in her father&rsquo;s house, while practicing daily flagellations and extreme fasting. Because of the severity of her actions, and their effects on her health, her biographer Raymond of Capua tells his readers that her family required her to keep her door ajar (V, 52). As she had decided early in life to dedicate herself to God, Catherine had initially followed a traditional approach typical of the hermitage and cloistering of oneself, a popular form of spirituality through the Middle Ages. Indeed, the 13th and 14th centuries found fertile ground for religious expression in the urban centers of Italy &mdash; especially in Siena &mdash; with male and particularly female recluses well supported by the city, and visible to society. In the year of Catherine&rsquo;s birth, 80% of Siena&rsquo;s recluses were women (</span><span class="c1">Thurber</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;47). By the second half of the 14th century, urban reclusion, which existed on the boundaries of cities and the boundaries of institutionalized religion, began to decline, while the third order &ldquo;secular&rdquo; vocations,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;for those who wanted to be part of a religious community without greatly changing their current lives, were increasingly considered to be more appropriate channels for female lay religious expression (Thurber 72). Although Catherine had at first seemed content in her reclusive life, she was eventually compelled by God to lead a public </span><span class="c1">life</span><span class="c1">.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">While Catherine certainly spent her early years as an ascetic, her transition to communal space seems to have been grounded in her experiences. In her youth, she was attracted to the travelling Dominican preachers (Order of Friars Preachers) who came through Siena, and, as Raymond explains, Catherine so esteemed these Dominican friars that she longed to enter their Order to help guide people in spiritual matters. However, Catherine realized that her status as a woman would prevent her from joining them, leading her to consider following Saint Euphrosyne&rsquo;s model to pass herself as a man (III, 38). As Carolyn Muessig notes, Catherine would eventually prove to be an </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;itinerant peacemaker, papal representative of sorts, spiritual counselor, theologian, and tireless letter writer&rdquo;</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;(4). And Raymond himself writes that &ldquo;her life was to follow lines far different from those of other women,&rdquo; as God sent her to live among people, working for others in public places (XII, 116). However, it was through communities of civic-minded and spiritual women that Catherine learned and flourished, and throughout her life she served as a community-builder and advocate to both secular and religious, regardless of gender. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Catherine joined the </span><span class="c0">Mantellate</span><span class="c1">, a tertiary order of the Dominicans consisting of mostly widowed and married laywomen, when she was about 18 years old. The women at first did not want to accept her, as her status as a virgin was not typical of the order, but she was persistent and persuasive, as she would also prove to be in her subsequent political affairs. When Catherine first joined, she was still committed to prayer and solitude, but her work for the ill as a </span><span class="c0">mantellata</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;may have contributed in compelling her to leave her private space. The </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;were dedicated to caring for the ill and doing good, and it was in hospitals that these groups of women gathered. Their center in Siena was the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala, near the Duomo. As Jane Tylus notes, the hospital &ldquo;represented an intermediary space between public and private ... for the layperson dedicated to acts of mercy&rdquo; (68). Because of Siena&rsquo;s location on the Via Francigena, the ancient pilgrimage route to Rome, the </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cared not only for their geographical neighbors but also for many visitors. Thus, Catherine&rsquo;s position as a lay Dominican proved to be beneficial though her initial desire to be in the </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;may have seemed contradictory. In this position, she had access to larger circles of people through her affiliation with the Dominicans and was able to engage with people of the world by living outside of a monastery, not unlike her Italian predecessor, Francis of Assisi.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In 1374, Catherine first traveled to Florence, and she spent most of 1375 in Pisa, where she cultivated a greater public reputation. While she had started constructing herself as a public figure in Siena, she generated excitement during her extended stay in Pisa and established herself as a public preacher and miracle worker (Capecelatro 107, Tylus 134). It is from Pisa that Catherine begins to engage in intense and frequent letter-writing, often addressing her spiritual and blood </span><span class="c0">famiglia</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in Siena. In 1376 she traveled to Avignon and is credited with the pope&rsquo;s return to Rome in September of that year, proving herself as effectively engaged in politics. Still, as a woman in the public sphere, she was accused of vainglory, which Raymond sought to defend throughout the last chapter of his </span><span class="c0">Legenda</span><span class="c14 c1">. As one may expect, this is a gendered issue, as Raymond notes her critics claimed, &ldquo;&lsquo;She&rsquo;s a woman. Why doesn&rsquo;t she stay in her cell, if it&rsquo;s God she wants to serve?&rsquo;&rdquo; (IV, 365). Raymond writes that both men and women are accusatory, but in the face of persecution she proved her sanctity through steadfastness, commitment to the public work of God, as well as her desire for martyrdom. Although he mentions Catherine&rsquo;s companions often and writes of Catherine&rsquo;s public outreach, he in some ways works to assert her as a solitary holy figure, committed primarily to working miracles and contemplation. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Remarkably, for a figure we know today due to her own textual legacy, Raymond&rsquo;s mentions of writing in the </span><span class="c0">Legenda </span><span class="c1">refer only to his own endeavors. When he discusses the act of reading, he primarily speaks to the present reader engaged with his text. However, according to the anonymously authored </span><span class="c0">Miracoli di Caterina di Iacopo da Siena</span><span class="c1">, Catherine read aloud to her fellow </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;at supper time, which Tylus notes &ldquo;situates Catherine in a world of women who, far from spreading snide words about her imagined sanctity, are listening to her read&rdquo; (127). Meanwhile, Raymond&rsquo;s own </span><span class="c0">Legenda major</span><span class="c1">, Caffarini&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">Leggenda minore </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c0">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c1">, Stefano Maconi&rsquo;s and the Pope&rsquo;s letters &mdash; to name a few &mdash; are all indicative of Catherine&rsquo;s participation not just in a female community but as an active interlocutor of the male religious community as well. Her letters on practical matters (to a prostitute, a Jewish moneylender), political leaders (the Queen of Naples, the Queen of Hungary, the King of France) and concerning the justice system (T273) reveal her participation in wider civic society. </span><span class="c1">Therefore, Catherine of Siena is not a mystic bound by her interiority and other-worldliness, but rather an active force in this world &mdash; her contemporary Italy &mdash; and a remarkable human who can operate outside and within societal constructs. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Catherine wrote a number of texts; the work that seemed to have been the most significant to her was what she referred to as her </span><span class="c0">Libro</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&mdash; the </span><span class="c0">Dialogo della divina provvidenzia. </span><span class="c1">This is a dialogue of 167 chapters between the soul who rises up and God, written a few years before her death during a period of about 13 months, between October 1377 and November 1378. The text generally concerns itself with the spiritual welfare of the reader and features significant thematic overlap with her letters. An important text within the context of publishing and readership, the </span><span class="c0">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was first printed within the initial few years of the technology having been introduced within Italy, quickly following the printing of Bibles. The first printed edition was done in 1472 by Azzoguidi in Bologna, and it has been printed about 70 times since then; meaning there has been about one edition for every 7-8 years (</span><span class="c1">Cavallini</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c1">). Catherine&rsquo;s prayers make up another set of her texts that were primarily written down by disciples during her ecstatic visions, mostly recorded in Rome, from December 1378 to 1380. Prayer 6, however, is described by Caffarini as to have been written in Catherine&rsquo;s own hand at Rocca di Tentennano in the Val d&rsquo;Orcia.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;The collection of nearly 380 extant letters of Catherine&rsquo;s reveal how she was a living saint embedded in her community, who developed and fostered a strong network of literary exchange. Her 10-year prolific letter-writing career began in 1370, with letters addressed to men and women, with recipients located throughout Siena, Tuscany, the Italian peninsula, and into Europe.</span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.vrlfeyopaw6g"><span class="c24">Catherine as Writer</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his 1524 text </span><span class="c0">De institutione feminae christianae</span><span class="c1">, Juan Luis Vives explicates his curriculum for teaching the Christian girl &mdash; for his purposes, the future female elite of England. He mentions Catherine of Siena as among the virtuous exempla of Christian women in his chapter &ldquo;On the Instruction of Young Girls.&rdquo; As this work is dedicated to the English Queen Catherine of Aragon (mother of Queen Mary I), it would certainly have been remiss of him to not include her namesakes, first Catherine of Alexandria, then &ldquo;The learned virgin of the same name, Catherine of Siena, [who] left fitting monuments of her genius in which the purity of her saintly intellect is resplendent&rdquo; (IV, 25). The English translator and editor of the modern edition, Charles Fantazzi, issues a footnote here &mdash; &ldquo;Catherine Benincasa &hellip; was not a very learned woman, as Vives states. She dictated her writings in the beautiful Tuscan vernacular of Siena&rdquo; (69). Though Vives may be cultivating the esteem of his patron here, what is interesting is that he is writing prior to Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s designation as a Church Doctor &mdash; a title reserved for those who have contributed to theology or doctrine, and who are regarded as the great teachers of Catholic followers &mdash; and Fantazzi glosses the text with some &ldquo;insight&rdquo; about Catherine&rsquo;s lack of learning </span><span class="c0">after</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;she had received this honor. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Though she lacked a strictly formal education &mdash; of the kind that Vives put forth in his instruction manual &mdash; Catherine did set out to be educated in general terms, and to learn to read in particular. A friend and fellow </span><span class="c0">mantellata</span><span class="c1">,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Alessa de&rsquo; Saracini</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(a woman!) served as her teacher, and Catherine did successfully learn to read the Tuscan vernacular, as well as physically write it in at least an elementary manner (Noffke, </span><span class="c0">Vision Through A Distant Eye</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;40). As a noblewoman, Alessa was educated at least in the Italian language, and Catherine was wise to enlist the help of a woman from the higher classes to learn to read. Though Catherine is painted as a literate woman to various degrees throughout her biographies and hagiographies, the agency afforded to her literacy differs. Raymond writes, &ldquo;I must tell you, reader, that this holy virgin knew how to read without being taught by human beings,&rdquo; and continues to explain that Catherine was unable to learn through the assistance of her friend, but instead learned through divine miraculous intervention (79). While miracles make for a compelling case in efforts toward canonization, and divine teaching may be more appropriate for a holy woman during Catherine&rsquo;s lifetime to gain respect, it is unlikely that a person putting her mind toward learning to read would be unsuccessful with patient guidance. Catherine&rsquo;s learning from fellow women situates her inside of a community that is outside of traditional hierarchical modes of elite privilege, and instead contextualizes her as someone who both contributes to and benefits from this Sienese community.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Reading would serve Catherine throughout her life and spiritual devotion. As the text </span><span class="c0">Miracoli di Caterina di Iacopo da Siena</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;notes, she would read about the saints while at the table with her companions, as she would never eat a larger quantity than a nut (&ldquo;ella legge delle cose de&rsquo; Santi , perocch&eacute; tutte le cose che ella si mette in bocca recando in uno non farebbono quantit&agrave; quanto una noce&rdquo; (</span><span class="c1">Valli</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;9)). Throughout each of her days, she would also be sure to dedicate some time to reading (</span><span class="c0">ibid</span><span class="c14 c1">.):</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1">Tutto l&rsquo;altro tempo del d&igrave;, poich&rsquo; &egrave; levata la mensa, ispende o in amaestrare genti di seguire la via di Dio, o in contemplare, et di stare rapita come di sopra &egrave; detto, o in leggere libri santi; ma il pi&ugrave; suo tempo &egrave; quello della contemplazione, se ella fosse lasciata, perocch&eacute; &egrave; molto visitata per divozione di genti che la vogliono vedere per pigliare assemplo et dottrina da lei.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Throughout her day, she is in devotion herself, reading, in contemplation, in ecstasy, or people visit to learn from her &mdash;she is very much a part of a literate, teaching and learning community. Probably due to the construction of gender at the time, and following Raymond&rsquo;s lead, this anonymous writer tries to emphasize Catherine&rsquo;s commitment to contemplation. In this text, the many visiting people are almost described as a nuisance, but what is significant about their presence is that others </span><span class="c0">are seeking knowledge from her</span><span class="c14 c1">, even if she is not considered learned in an exclusive elite sense of the word.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In addition to her reading, Catherine seems to have been successful as an auditory learner, attending scholarly preaching and instructional sessions designed for the </span><span class="c0">Mantellate</span><span class="c1">. For Catherine, writing and speech are never far apart, as both are methods to spread God&rsquo;s Word. She had a very retentive memory as evidenced by her summoning of many Biblical passages from the Latin Vulgate Bible in her writing. This sharp memory causes one of her recent biographers and translators, Suzanne Noffke, to question Catherine&rsquo;s command of Latin, which Raymond stated that she could read and pronounce (though not speak). It seems that Catherine occasionally misquoted scriptures through corruption of her auditory reception of the texts. Still, her </span><span class="c1">intellectual pursuit of Latin</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;reading is evidenced in a letter from Tommaso Caffarini, a follower and biographer, in which he writes, &ldquo;Mi dimandasti se quello verso del salmo: </span><span class="c0">Domine non est exaltatum cor meum</span><span class="c1">, vuol dire </span><span class="c0">sicut adlattatus </span><span class="c1">sanza el b, o </span><span class="c0">sicut ablattatus</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;col b&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c0">Leggenda minore</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;1868 253, as quoted in Webb 803). This indicates an attention to the Latin language as well as a processing of the meaning of Latin words. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c1">The founder of the Order of Friars Preachers, Dominic de Guzman (1170-1221), believed that preaching was best practiced out of a firm foundation in theology, and as part of his commitment to learning, he sent his brothers to be educated in Christian doctrine throughout the universities of Europe, wishing for them to recruit others to also be educated. The famous erudite Dominican friar, Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), was an influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism during his lifetime, and is now honored as a Doctor of the Church, like Catherine. This tradition of learning and education within the Dominican Order manifested itself in Catherine, as she propagated this legacy within her own practice. Her predecessor Thomas Aquinas was also there when she was taught by God to write in her own hand in Letter T272:</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1">Questa lettera, e un&rsquo;altra ch&rsquo;io vi mandai, ho scritte di mia mano in su l&rsquo;isola della Rocca, con molti sospiri e abondanzia di lagrime; in tanto che l&rsquo;occhio, vedendo, non vedeva; ma piena d&rsquo;ammirazione ero di me medesima, e della bont&agrave; di Dio, considerando la sua misericordia verso le creature che hanno in loro ragione, e la sua Providenzia; la quale abondava verso di me, che per refrigerio, essendo privata della consolazione, la quale per mia ignoranzia io non cognobbi, m&rsquo;aveva dato, e proveduto con darmi l&rsquo;attitudine dello scrivere; acciocch&egrave; discendendo dall&rsquo;altezza, avessi un poco con chi sfogare &rsquo;l cuore, perch&egrave; non scoppiasse. Non volendomi trarre ancora di questa tenebrosa vita; per ammirabile modo me la ferm&ograve; nella mente mia, siccome fa il maestro al fanciullo, che gli d&agrave; lo esempio. Onde, subito che fuste partito da me col glorioso evangelista Joanni e Tommaso di Aquino, cos&igrave; dormendo cominciai ad imparare.

However, due to her status as a woman at the bottom of conventional hierarchies, she also insists that she is ignorant, straddling a fine line between education and lack thereof. Though at the time, actually writing something down was largely considered a technical skill and scribes were often utilized to render thoughts on the page, Catherine sees her ability to write as a comfort and solace. When she is alone and without a scribe upon returning to the earthly realm from the height of divine mystical experience, through the act of writing, Catherine is able to pour out her heart onto the page rather than feel it burst.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is an important locus for Catherine, a metaphor she uses frequently in her writing, considering it to be a masculine body part that is simultaneously a source of nourishment, while also using the symbol for its religious and Aristotelian implications.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;What is perhaps most fascinating about her descriptions of the heart is that she orients it accurately,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;which is information that she would not have been able to glean from contemporary public depictions, according to Heather Webb, who explains that only anatomical descriptions of the heart oriented the organ properly during Catherine&rsquo;s lifetime (&ldquo;Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s Heart&rdquo; 804). As Catherine explains &ldquo;how the literal shape of the heart reflects the ideal shape of human affections, with the greater portion directed toward heaven,&rdquo; Webb argues that it becomes evident that Catherine utilized Dominican encyclopedic sources, drawing from Antonio Volpato&rsquo;s research</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;on Catherine&rsquo;s drawing from these Dominican encyclopedias that often contained depictions of physiology (&ldquo;Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s Heart&rdquo; 805). Catherine is not the only mystic to have been intrigued by science, and biology in particular, as Hildegard of Bingen wrote on scientific and medicinal uses of natural objects in both </span><span class="c0">Physica</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">Causae et Curae</span><span class="c1">,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and Teresa of &Aacute;vila punctuates her </span><span class="c0">Libro de la vida</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with symbols of water, soil, and nature to describe what Mar&iacute;a M. Carri&oacute;n refers to as &ldquo;sustainable </span><span class="c1">devotion</span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><span class="c1">.&rdquo; While Catherine&rsquo;s utilization of Dominican encyclopedic sources further confirms her own literacy, it also indicates a general interest in learning that is not limited to reading and writing. Her seeking out of knowledge about the natural world alongside theology points to a commitment to greater understanding and sharing of that knowledge through teaching. As she is able to learn in the traditional sense of listening, reading, and speaking with the educated </span><span class="c0">famiglia</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;that she cultivated around her, but also gleans a special knowledge through mystical experience, she seeks out public speaking and writing to help others gain from what she has learned and what she has taught (and likewise others seek her out). </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Despite her efforts to learn across fields, gaining the knowledge in and writing using the vernacular language was not considered to be true literacy in a Latinate world. Though Catherine was born half a century after Dante had written </span><span class="c0">De vulgari eloquentia</span><span class="c1">, little had changed regarding the status of the Italian and Latin languages, and what participating in those language communities meant. Latin &mdash; the language of upper-class men, intellectual humanists, and the church &mdash; presented a clear barrier that prevented common people and women in particular from accessing information. Though Catherine </span><span class="c0">was</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;interested in participating in the same language as this separate and self-monitoring exclusive group (as is evident in her efforts to learn Latin), she consciously and emphatically would choose Sienese Italian as her language of writing and speech. As a religious figure doing good work in the world, offering comfort, advice, and care to the prisoners, penitent women, and ill of Siena, how could she choose to communicate in a language they would not be able to understand? Having learned to write through her own community, and being a publicly-engaged woman who addressed her fellow Sienese in speeches in the piazza or through dispatched letters, Catherine was working to include the poor, sick, uneducated and sinful, rather than exclude them. As both a learner and a teacher of God, tasked with delivering messages of the divine to others, the local language of her time was incredibly instrumental to gain followers and communicate. Indeed, her use of language is remarkably similar to Francis of Assisi&rsquo;s equity-driven approach to spirituality, as he wrote what are considered to be the first Italian language texts in the Umbrian dialect as a means to engage all those in his community who could not understand Latin. His prayer-song, &ldquo;Cantico delle creature,&rdquo; even extols the disenfranchised group of non-human animals, appreciating their dignity in being the creatures of God.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;Catherine&rsquo;s use of language is consistent with her spirituality (as well as Christ&rsquo;s inclusive teachings), which is public, community-based, and poetic while also being meaningful and significant. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Where Catherine did exclude by language was in letters she wrote in her native Sienese to prominent foreign men and women who likely had little or no grasp of Italian. In response to this, Raymond notably would send an accompanying messenger to Pope Gregory XI in order to interpret, </span><span class="c0">viva voce</span><span class="c1">, Catherine&rsquo;s words into Latin, thus creating a performative and multivalent text (Tylus 161). Though this may be viewed as an intent to diminish Catherine&rsquo;s Italian, especially when considering that Raymond also quickly worked to have her </span><span class="c0">Libro </span><span class="c1">translated into Latin, this was actually an effective method for retaining Catherine&rsquo;s agency and community-focused ideals while also accommodating the Pope. As with all of her language-based choices, Catherine&rsquo;s use of the vernacular in her letters, especially those addressed to the Pope, serves not only a literary choice, but also a political one: Catherine&rsquo;s activities were directed towards returning the papal seat from France to Italy (Tylus 162). Similarly, Raymond&rsquo;s work was invested in Catherine&rsquo;s canonization, and he was well aware that for a female mystic to access the church hierarchy in this way, she would have to be presented in the language of the elite rather than the language of the people. Translating texts into Latin also ensured the circulation of texts across linguistic boundaries, as they could subsequently be translated into local vernaculars (as with the translation of Catherine&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Libro</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and Raymond&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">Vita</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;into English, discussed below). Italian women religious, like Angela of Foligno and Elena da Udine, did not enjoy the same relatively quick canonization that Catherine did, as most of the texts surrounding their lives were in the vernacular. Angela of Foligno (d. 1309) was not canonized until 2013 by the current Pope Francis, and Elena da Udine (d. 1458), whose notarized vernacular life was written by Simone da Roma, was only beatified </span><span class="c1">after</span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;the composition of Giacomo da Udine&rsquo;s interesting late 15th-century Latin text that focused on her ascent into heaven (</span><span class="c0">Vita Helenae utinensis</span><span class="c1">).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Although today we may consider authorial dictation to be not quite the same skill as writing, it is worth noting that the great English poet John Milton was blind by the time he wrote </span><span class="c0">Paradise Lost </span><span class="c1">from 1658 to 1664 (with the second edition written in 1674), and &ldquo;Contemporary accounts relate that </span><span class="c1">Milton</span><sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><span class="c1">, whose eyes finally failed completely in 1651, would dictate to his daughter Deborah, his nephew, or a paid amanuensis every day&rdquo; (Farmer 19). There are numerous paintings of Milton dictating to his daughters, including the 1826 painting by Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, suggesting a romanticizing of the oral epic nature of the text, which calls to mind the great works of classical poets like Homer, but also shows an intimate community between writer and scribe. Also, these paintings do not seem to call into question the fact that the one who is manually writing is female, with authorship remaining firmly with the esteemed male poet Milton. However, this charming literary tableau is not afforded to Catherine. As a driving force of her monograph, </span><span class="c0">Reclaiming Catherine of Siena</span><span class="c1">, Jane Tylus problematizes Catherine as a &ldquo;producer of words,&rdquo; only trying to claim that she was &ldquo;certainly a woman intrigued by the technology of writing and interested in exploiting it for a variety of spiritual reasons&rdquo; (18). Tylus mentions Stephen Botterill as among the dissenters to Catherine as writer. It is worth quoting Botterill&rsquo;s gloss in the </span><span class="c0">Cambridge History of Italian Literature</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;(considered to be a standard scholarly text) at length (125):</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1">In all these writings Catherine handles the vernacular with subtlety and force, commanding a wide range of tonal registers and using her expressive medium with supple ease and pithy eloquence that make her letters, in particular, one of the monuments of epistolary tradition. But the idea of Catherine as &ldquo;author&rdquo; of her own texts bring with it several extra-literary problems that affect interpretation. Born and raised in working-class poverty, and subject, like nearly all women of her century, to virtually complete exclusion from the realm of education and literate culture, she learned to read and write only near the end of her life. Most if not all of her &ldquo;writings&rdquo; were thus orally dictated to (male) secretaries, foremost among them the famous friar Raimondo da Capua. It is by no means clear exactly what role these secretaries played in editing, revising or otherwise preparing Catherine&rsquo;s dictated texts for circulation in manuscript; and any conception of Catherine as a woman writer of the Trecento &mdash; a </span><span class="c0">rara avis</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;indeed &mdash; needs to be modified by attention to the individual and social realities that govern her work, and which include substantial involvement by men in the preservation of that work in written form.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There are quite a few assumptions made on Botterill&rsquo;s part here, which stem from a discourse that must modify the woman writing as a &ldquo;woman writer&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;writer.&rdquo; Although he will grant that Catherine effectively &ldquo;handles&rdquo; language (he does not state that it is her scribes doing this handling), he will not afford her authorship. The neologism &ldquo;working-class&rdquo; is anachronistic and unclear &mdash; her father was a wool-dyer, a skilled worker and likely providing more than poverty for his family as part of Italy&rsquo;s growing artisanal class. As is noted in her biographies, Catherine&rsquo;s family provided her with her own small room within the familial house in which to pray, a luxury not indicative of a poor father. Catherine, a mystic and future saint, chose the life of poverty for herself rather than marry. It is also assumed that education was limited to the realm of a formal education, and that a knowledge of reading and writing could not be attained outside of elite male institutional study. Even the fact that Catherine went to fellow women to attain literacy suggests that a grassroots-style education could be realized by women and the non-elite living in Siena during her time. Reserving the title of &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; or &ldquo;master&rdquo; for Christ alone, Catherine clearly was not participating in the same kind of educational system that Botterill describes (Noffke 58). The &ldquo;literate culture&rdquo; he refers to is likely the Latin literacy discussed above, a literacy that was exclusionary and inequitable. The note of &ldquo;(male) secretaries&rdquo; is also inaccurate, as Catherine employed secretaries from both sexes, as is evidenced in many letters that state which women are there with her.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Though the men around her worked to promote Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality and sainthood, there is little to indicate that they would mishandle her texts &mdash; they are part of her </span><span class="c0">famiglia </span><span class="c14 c1">and go to her for advice, why should the assumption be that they would change her words when they, part of Latinate culture, do not prevent her from writing in Italian? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Concluding that Catherine has little or no control of her dictated texts based on little evidence while assuming that men who used scribes had full control is a problematic stance. While we do not have writing extant in her own hand, we also do not have much of the writing in the hand of male writers from her period, either (including Dante and Francis of </span><span class="c1">Assisi</span><sup><a href="#cmnt10" id="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt11" id="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup><span class="c1">). Writing in a communal setting is exactly what we may expect from a figure so embedded in her city and culture, and though in some letters she notes when she writes in her own hand, writing as a solitary and scholarly pursuit alone does not truly capture the full range of the nature of writing. Collaborative writing, as with collaborative visual art, was among the expressions of writing and the arts through the Middle Ages and Renaissance (acknowledging collaborative writing is integral to our understanding of Shakespeare)</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c1">, and to afford some collaborative negotiation as part of Catherine&rsquo;s writing process is not to diminish her writing and authorship any more than male writers who are also likely not writing entirely alone and never sharing or receiving feedback on their work, which is also likely edited by others. If we are to contextualize Catherine, as Botterill suggests we do, it is to reveal her as a writer of her own time, part of a growing discourse of writing in the developing Italian language, and among the innovators of that language, employing unique and consistent metaphors and imagery while also persuasively enacting diplomacy &mdash; indicative of both her poetic prowess and rhetorical style.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;Writing has always proven to be a site of collaboration and negotiation, and this persists to this day; if we are to problematize Catherine&rsquo;s authorship, we must also problematize authorship in general, which has a long theoretical history, but is outside of the scope of this present study. For this work, the stance that will be taken is the stance that is afforded to male writers.</span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.uj2mq3p8exc2"><span class="c24">The Figure of the Mystic</span></h3><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c1">Catherine of Siena, as a writer and reader, student and teacher outside of traditional and established elite hierarchies, proves herself to be a liminal figure, pushing against conventional norms while also capable of moving through and working within prescribed systems. Her success as a writer, as a religious figure, and as a saint, depended very much on her ability to construct herself in ways that were within and without acceptable boundaries for what a 14th-century Italian woman were. In many ways, her robust efforts at community building served her well throughout her life and continued to serve her in the construction of her legacy. But another aspect of her life also clearly guided her spirituality as well as her approach to writing and even her community development: mysticism. Understanding Catherine as a mystic is crucial for contextualizing the reasons why she engaged in so much outreach, and how writing fit into her religiosity and social justice-driven approach to faith. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the figure of the mystic: how the mystic is theoretically cast as a transgressive figure at the borders of binaries but also outside of them. Thinking about Catherine in these terms will enable us to move forward with her writing from the theoretically grounded perspective that she is functioning within and without the boundaries of male and female, human and divine, sanctioned and unsanctioned.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A year before his death, Sigmund Freud writes a single sentence in an entry dated August 22, 1938: &ldquo;Mysticism is the obscure self-perception of the realm outside the ego, of the </span><span class="c1">id</span><sup><a href="#cmnt12" id="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo; (&ldquo;Mystik de dunkle Selbstwahrehmung des Reiches ausserhalb des Ichs, des Es&rdquo;). Though Freud wrote on mysticism throughout his life, he did not view it as a means to religious redemption, but seemed to couple it more with psychoanalysis itself, as a way to know that which exists outside of the ego, in direct contact with the id.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;In general, Freud sees mysticism as irrational and in lack of an organizing language, while still probing at an intellectual problem that cannot be grasped by the rational self. Though many theorists will agree with its irrationality and further identify the mystic as a pathological figure, others view mysticism to be a domain within which a specific language is explored and brought to light, beyond the boundaries of learned and self-conscious speech and writing. For feminist theorists, the language is largely charged with amorous expression due to mysticism being intrinsically joined with femininity and a state of loving and even eroticism. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In </span><span class="c0">The Second Sex</span><span class="c1">, Simone de Beauvoir characterizes the mystic as a lover </span><span class="c1">desirous of </span><sup><a href="#cmnt13" id="cmnt_ref13">[m]</a></sup><span class="c1">Christ, associated with blood and self-annihilation, and ostensibly a woman. As part of Beauvoir</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s argument throughout the broader text, love is assigned to woman as her supreme vocation &mdash; that is, she is defined by the loving she does. When a woman loves a man, Beauvoir explains, she is seeking God in this man. Man is the representation of God (or the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span class="c1">), and as Lacan further demonstrates, &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">The phallus is the signifier of signifiers, the privileged signifier of that mark in which the role of the logos is joined with the advent of desire</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0">E&#769;crits</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;287). For man, reason and desire and the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are conflated, but as woman is without the phallus, she is relegated to the lover, only capable of desiring the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span class="c1">, typically in the form of a man. If, Beauvoir writes, human love is denied to her &mdash; whether due to her having been disappointed in love, or her having been too selective in choosing a lover &mdash; she may seek the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in the person of God himself. Interestingly, by choosing to direct herself to God, the female mystic is superseding the intermediary force of the male human and is encountering the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;unimpeded, desiring this true signifier of signifiers rather than the corporeal representation of God found in man. The female mystic using love (even desirous love) as a vehicle toward desiring and comprehending the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is exactly in line with Christian theology, as </span><span class="c1">Dante</span><sup><a href="#cmnt14" id="cmnt_ref14">[n]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt15" id="cmnt_ref15">[o]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt16" id="cmnt_ref16">[p]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;so aptly illustrates in erotic language throughout </span><span class="c0">Paradiso</span><sup><a href="#cmnt17" id="cmnt_ref17">[q]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;by borrowing from the eroticism inherent in the biblical Song of Songs and hagiographies (e.g., St. Francis marrying Poverty).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;The blending of </span><span class="c0">caritas</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">eros</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as a method for approaching the divine and thus the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or God is a legitimate expression of faith that simultaneously disrupts psychoanalytic gendering of women through their channeling of desirous love to encounter the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;unmediated by masculine </span><span class="c0">accoutrements</span><span class="c14 c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c1">Much of the tension surrounding the mystic in theoretical inquiry pivots around the perception of the mystic as an hysterical figure. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cixous views the mystic as being aligned with hysteria rather than religiosity &mdash; a non-mystical religious woman, for Cixous, is an obsessive-compulsive, whereas an hysterical woman is an artist and revolutionary. In my reading, and as Amy Hollywood notes in general terms, theorists typically denigrate the affective and expressive embodiments of mysticism, though the rare exceptions (Bataille, Beauvoir, Lacan, Irigaray) view these women less pathologically and instead as subversive figures who can effectively merge action and contemplation, emotion and reason, body and soul. Teresa of Avila and Angela of Foligno are discussed in particular throughout theoretical writing on mysticism, and Simone de Beauvoir specifically writes on Joan of Arc and Catherine of Siena as well. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c1">On Catherine of Siena, Beauvoir in fact mentions her prior to discussing the mystic in particular, when she addresses the special status of queens and saints, who, she argues, were afforded more social support than other women and granted equality. Women she mentions in this regard include Clotilda, Radegonde, Blanche of Castile, Heloise, Joan of Arc, along with Catherine (104). As an Italian woman, Catherine is mentioned again when Beauvoir discusses how women made gains during the Italian Renaissance; she argues that there is individualism available for everyone regardless of sex, and that women became powerful sovereigns, military leaders, artists, writers and musicians (105). When she writes on the mystic in chapter 24 (670-678), in which she mentions Catherine on several occasions, she discusses how the mystic tries to annihilate herself, while also being especially concerned with blood, setting up an interesting mystical obsession with corporeality that is both a denial and a preoccupation with bodily fluid. For mystics, &ldquo;Ecstasy mimics corporeally that abolition of the ego;&rdquo; that is, whereas other loving women may abolish only their psychological egos, mystics also annihilate their flesh (675). </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, they are also especially concerned with blood, which Beauvoir claims is part of indulging in &ldquo;sado-masochistic fantasies,&rdquo; and mentions that &ldquo;St Catherine of Siena refers to [Christ&rsquo;s blood] in most of her letters&rdquo; (676, 677). Of course, Catherine evokes the blood of Christ within the rhetorical structure of every one of her fully extant letters. As a liminal figure between the Middle Ages and the early modern period, Catherine is very much engaging with a form of medieval devotion that is concerned with Christ&rsquo;s blood, and referring to this as sadomasochistic is certainly an anachronistic reading. What is more unsound about Beauvoir&rsquo;s analysis on the mystic is that she writes, &ldquo;To be sure, there have also been men who burned with that flame, but they are rare and their fervor is of a highly refined intellectual cast, whereas the women who abandon themselves to the joys of the heavenly nuptials are legion, and their experience is of a peculiarly emotional nature&rdquo; (670). I say this is unsound, because not only does it incorrectly estimate the number of male mystics (there are many more male mystics than female mystics)</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">, but also because it sets up a false dichotomy of mystical expression. What is not intellectual about Hildegard and Catherine? What is not emotional about Bernard of Clairvaux and Francis of Assisi?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c1">Where Beauvoir&rsquo;s examination is rich and vital is when she discusses the relationship between action and contemplation, which is what gets at the heart of Catherine&rsquo;s mysticism. Beauvoir maintains that for some women, &ldquo;Ecstasies, visions, talks with God &mdash; this inner experience is enough,&rdquo; but that &ldquo;[o]thers feel impelled to transmit it to the world through acts&rdquo; (677). She further explains that these are &ldquo;women of action [. . .] who know very well what goals they have in mind and who lucidly devise means for attaining them: their visions simply provide objective images for their certitudes&rdquo; (678). For Beauvoir, Teresa of &Agrave;vila is the preeminent embodiment of this mystical sensibility, but she includes Catherine of Siena and Joan of Arc among the women who use contemplation to fuel their action in the world. What is significant here is that there is a balance and an occupation of a liminal space between contemplation and action. Where many religious figures are revered for their meditative approach to spirituality, mystics are typically engaging with the wider world in some way, to transmit their knowledge through text, or to be involved in doing charitable and political works for wider social good.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c1">As Beauvoir does dwell on Catherine of Siena in her text, it is worthwhile to quote her assessment of the mystic at length (104):</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1">the story of St Catherine of Siena is significant; in the midst of a quite normal existence she created in Siena a great reputation by her active benevolence and by the visions that testified to her intense inner life; thus she acquired the authority necessary for success, which women usually lack. Appeal was made to her influence in exhorting those condemned to death, in bringing back wanderers, and in allaying quarrels between families and cities. She had the support of a society that recognized itself in her, and thus it was that she could fulfill her mission of pacification, preaching from city to city submission to the Pope, keeping up extensive correspondence with bishops and rulers, and in the end being chosen by Florence as ambassadress to go to seek out the Pope in Avignon.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c14 c1">Catherine&rsquo;s &ldquo;active charit&eacute;&rdquo; is juxtaposed with her &ldquo;visions qui manifestent son intense vie int&eacute;rieure,&rdquo; but rather than occupying two different aspects of Catherine&rsquo;s approach to life, they support and drive each other (169). As a person inciting works of charity and spiritual policy, Catherine was an inherent element of her community, and she reflected back the community she was a part of and helped to maintain (&ldquo;Elle est soutenue par la collectivit&eacute; qui se reconna&icirc;t en elle&rdquo; (169)). As Beauvoir sees Catherine, the active life and the contemplative life are impossible to disentangle, and serve as the foundation of Catherine&rsquo;s mysticism.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine&rsquo;s own texts adroitly blend the active with the contemplative, emphasizing her act of doing good works in the world as part of her spirituality. In a letter to the Dominican abbess and nuns of San Pietro in Monticelli a Lignaia in Florence, she writes (T79):</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1">E non lassi la buona operazione con santi desiderii, n&egrave; per tentazione del dimonio, n&egrave; per fragilit&agrave; della carne &hellip; E non debbe lassare il servire al prossimo suo, n&egrave; di cercare la salute sua, per ingratitudine n&egrave; per ignoranzia, che non cognoscesse il servizio. Non debbe lassare; perocch&egrave;, se lassasse, parrebbe che cercasse d&rsquo;essere retribuito da loro, e non da Dio: la quale cosa non si debbe fare, ma prima eleggere la morte.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">For Catherine, doing good is intrinsically tied to holy desire, and nothing should prevent the servants of God from serving their neighbors, whether it is corporeal weakness or their neighbors&rsquo; ingratitude. She emphasizes that their fellow earth-bound humans cannot offer them a reward, so they should not seek one from them but from God through eternal life. This letter, which Noffke dates to October 1377, is contemporaneous with Catherine&rsquo;s writing of the </span><span class="c0">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">, and this sentiment of loving thy neighbor through service is reiterated in a statement of God&rsquo;s in </span><span class="c0">Dialogo 7</span><span class="c14 c1">:</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1">come io non voglia altro che amore, poich&eacute; l&rsquo;uomo esercita l&rsquo;amore del prossimo nell&rsquo;amore di me.

This service or active charity is such a crucial component of Catherine&rsquo;s mysticism and general mode of living in the world, that she includes it in her advice letters directly to others as well as early on in her </span><span class="c0">Dialogo</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;which is intended for all to read and learn from.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Catherine was working on this merging of the active life with the contemplative life in her own daily activities, there is a contemporaneous shift in Renaissance hagiography from an other-worldly spirituality to a </span><span class="c1">this-worldly</span><sup><a href="#cmnt18" id="cmnt_ref18">[r]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt19" id="cmnt_ref19">[s]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt20" id="cmnt_ref20">[t]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;spirituality. Alison Knowles Frazier discusses this movement in her work, </span><span class="c0">Possible Lives: Authors and Saints in Renaissance Italy</span><span class="c1">, which is focused on representations of men living the </span><span class="c0">vita activa</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;alongside reform of religious life that generally moved men outside of communal cloisters and into city centers. Figures like St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Ambrose, St. Potitus and St. Nicholas are profiled in particular, and the Latin humanist writers generally prefer the male subject to the female, with about 5% of Dominican accounts and 25% of Franciscan accounts being about women (Frazier 35). The manifestation of this preference in hagiographies of Catherine&rsquo;s time reveals that this is an increasingly condoned modus operandi of religious expression, though the fact that it was almost entirely limited to male religious hagiographies shows that blending of action with contemplation was not typical or sanctioned for female religious figures like Catherine.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In fact, many women in the medieval and early modern periods would have been entirely precluded from having a &ldquo;this-worldly&rdquo; active life whether religious or not. Aristotle develops the crucial distinctions between </span><span class="c0">zoe </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c0">bios</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c0">oikos </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c0">polis</span><span class="c1">, limiting women to the realms of </span><span class="c0">zoe </span><span class="c1">(the biological life outside of politics) and </span><span class="c0">oikos </span><span class="c1">(the home), whereas men inhabit the domains of </span><span class="c0">bios</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(the qualified life, the life of society, and political life) and </span><span class="c0">polis</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(the city). Though there are some women who were able to engage in their local public contexts &mdash; like Mary Magdalene, Joan of Arc (until she was captured by England), Eleanor of Aquitaine, Vittoria Colonna &mdash; the vast majority of women through the Renaissance were unable to participate in the political life of the city, including those who claimed to have a higher divine impetus for doing so. In </span><span class="c0">Women of the Renaissance</span><span class="c1">, Margaret King notes that between the years of 1300 and 1700 &ldquo;witches&rdquo; in Italy outnumbered religious women 100 to 1, revealing that women who attempted to be viewed as religious and spread the word about their sanctity were much more frequently viewed to be demonic, </span><span class="c1">an accusation that Catherine herself had even endured from some skeptics (described by Raymond as her &ldquo;disparagers&rdquo; (176-7)), though she is distinguished as a Church Doctor today</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(145).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Even earlier female mystics like </span><span class="c1">Hildegard </span><sup><a href="#cmnt21" id="cmnt_ref21">[u]</a></sup><span class="c1">of Bingen led remarkable lives pursuing multivalent approaches to knowledge production and creative works, yet were proscribed from a public life outside the cloister apart from their letter writing endeavors. Though letter writing could be interpreted to be a subversive form of political engagement, and continues to be an important method of communication for later mystics and Catherine of Siena in particular, there is still a lack of public presence and public voice. Famously, a portion of Hildegard</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s </span><span class="c0">Scivias</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;was read aloud by Pope Eugenius III to assembled clergy, revealing how even a medieval woman</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s writing could participate in public performance, though the female voice of the writer is left unheard (</span><span class="c1">Logan 175</span><span class="c14 c1">). Catherine stepping outside of a designated role as female religious puts her in a vacillating space, not just between contemplative life and active life, but also between male and female expression.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Like Beauvoir</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s description of the woman intellectual</span><sup><a href="#cmnt22" id="cmnt_ref22">[v]</a></sup><span class="c1">, the mystic or even religious woman is othered twice: first she is an outsider contained within </span><span class="c0">zoe</span><span class="c1">, secondly she is an outsider for being something that is &ldquo;sacred.&rdquo; In Roman law, the </span><span class="c0">homo sacer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is one who cannot be sacrificed yet can be killed without the killer being condemned for homicide &mdash; those that are sacred belonging to the class of those who exist outside of society (Agamben 47). Priests, hermits, the sacrificial and the gods all exist outside of </span><span class="c0">bios</span><span class="c1">, outside of society and in a state of exclusion. Yet, all except God(s) are in some ways included in the form of exclusion &mdash; what Agamben describes as &ldquo;the ambiguity of the sacred&rdquo; &mdash; these sacred men are in some ways within and some ways without (50). Ambiguity consistently lies within the construction of the sacred, with overlapping between the holy and the unclean, for instance, which is an even more historically difficult line for women to negotiate. This is because the </span><span class="c0">femina sacra</span><span class="c1">, doubly without political life, is rendered twice removed. The &ldquo;witches&rdquo; killed throughout history for being part of this </span><span class="c0">femina sacra</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;classification suffered due to their twice-othered status, yet without any ramifications for those who killed them &mdash; in most cases the state. Though very few </span><span class="c0">feminae sacrae</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;were fortunate enough to escape death by the state successfully, this may have been due to their amplified outsider status. As sacred women, they were completely outside the world of man, just like God,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and were therefore closer to the word of God, viewed more often as a conduit for God</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s word in their mystical writing, than as a mediatrix channeling the </span><span class="c0">logos</span><span class="c14 c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As men were typically able to express their religious authority through learning, citation, rhetoric, and public engagement, they were not limited to the &ldquo;prophetic, visionary, or mystical claims [that] were the primary modes of religious authorization available to women&rdquo; (</span><span class="c1">Hollywood</span><span class="c1">, &ldquo;Gender, Agency&rdquo; 514). On the figure of the male mystic, Lacan writes, &ldquo;There are men who are just as good as women. It does happen. Despite, I won</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">t say their phallus, despite what encumbers them on that score, they get the idea, they sense there must be a </span><span class="c0">jouissance</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;which goes beyond. That is what we call a mystic&rdquo; (&ldquo;God and the </span><span class="c0">Jouissance</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;147</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;/ </span><span class="c1">S XX p. 76). Here, Lacan ties mysticism to bodily experience that is a painful pleasure (for him, beyond the phallus), an eroticism that could be said to be described frequently in mystical writing. Though corporeality and perceived sexual difference are subjects touched upon by mystics, along with images of sensually felt divine love, there is also at play a complication of gender throughout many mystical and religious texts that suggests that there is an aspect of mysticism that goes beyond not just </span><span class="c0">jouissance</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but also beyond a dichotomous gender binary. As Anne J. Cruz writes, &ldquo;female mystics verbalize a uniquely Christocentric position that both transgresses and transcends gender order,&rdquo; and I would add this to mystics in general, not just that male mystics participate in </span><span class="c0">jouissance</span><span class="c1">, but are equally inhabiting a complicated space that is both pushing at the boundaries and beyond the construction of </span><span class="c1">gender</span><sup><a href="#cmnt23" id="cmnt_ref23">[w]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;(134).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Running parallel yet divergent to the other creation stories of Genesis,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;the book of the generations of Adam, Genesis 5, reads, </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created</span><sup><a href="#cmnt24" id="cmnt_ref24">[x]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo; (1-2). That is, from the beginning, male and female are part of Adam, and are also, presumably, part of God, as Adam is created in God</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s image. This rings remarkably similar to Aristophanes</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s creation tale of the three sexes as described in Plato</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s </span><span class="c0">Symposium</span><span class="c1">, except that in Genesis 5 there is only one sex comprised of both male and female identity (189e-194e). Perhaps, like the four-legged androgyne of Aristophanes, the female part of Adam was excised to form Eve, and we have since inherited a double-sexed notion of gender which was largely enforced in the Middle Ages and early modern period. Yet, from these early religious texts, there is enough scope for two genders to exist in one body, suggesting a complication of gender from the very creation stories that propagate the Judeo-Christian tradition. Raymond reports that, when Catherine spoke to God about her misgivings of being female,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;God replied (90):</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c14 c1">Am not I He who created the human race, and divided it into male and female? I spread abroad the grace of my spirit where I will. In my eyes there is neither male nor female, rich nor poor, but all are equal, for I can do all things with equal ease.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c14 c1">Though Raymond&rsquo;s description of God&rsquo;s words are somewhat contradictory, this statement is in line with Genesis 5. Even if God divided humanity across male and female gendered lines, he indicates that he does not see them as separate or unequal beings, nor does he judge humans based on their economic status.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">From a linguistic perspective, the situation of the soul is decidedly feminine as the Latin word &ldquo;anima&rdquo; is a feminine word. Thus, mystical writers like Jerome, Gregory of Nyssa, Thomas Aquinas (in </span><span class="c0">Summa theologica </span><span class="c1">as well as </span><span class="c0">De anima</span><span class="c1">) and Bernard of Clairvaux view the soul as intrinsically feminine. For those writing in the vernacular, Meister Eckhart uses the German feminine noun &ldquo;Seele,&rdquo; and Catherine and Teresa of Avila will adopt the feminine &ldquo;a/&aacute;nima&rdquo; in their native Italian and Spanish, respectively. Though linguistic gender may not seem particularly remarkable, it is worth noting that Bonaventure opts for the Latin masculine word &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">mens</span><sup><a href="#cmnt25" id="cmnt_ref25">[y]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt26" id="cmnt_ref26">[z]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt27" id="cmnt_ref27">[aa]</a></sup><span class="c1">&rdquo; (mind) rather than &ldquo;anima,&rdquo; and that Bernard of Clairvaux speaks of himself and his fellow monks in feminine terms throughout his writing, perhaps informed by the gendered language in addition to the hierarchical position of the worshipper who approaches the divine (</span><span class="c1">Harmles</span><span class="c1">s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;49, 85). Indeed, Bernard</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s </span><span class="c0">Sermons on the </span><span class="c0">Song of Songs</span><sup><a href="#cmnt28" id="cmnt_ref28">[ab]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">speak to the malleability of the reader</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s gender, as the presumably male reader must place himself in the position of the presumably female bride &mdash; allegorically the Church &mdash; to the presumably male bridegroom of Christ.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;In this text, he describes being kissed on the mouth by Christ, and remarks on his female corporeality including breasts that swell with milk (</span><span class="c1">2.2, 9.2, 9.7</span><sup><a href="#cmnt29" id="cmnt_ref29">[ac]</a></sup><span class="c1">).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Famously, Bernard is also tied to breast </span><span class="c1">milk</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;due to his mystical vision known as </span><span class="c0">Lactatio Bernardi</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in which the Virgin Mary intervenes on his behalf, perhaps to cure an eye </span><span class="c1">infection</span><span class="c1">, by either shooting her milk into his eyes, or dripping it into his mouth. In his chapter on &ldquo;Bernard and Mary</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s Milk,&rdquo; Brian Patrick McGuire details a number of stories and visual art treatments that center around Bernard or another unnamed monk from Clairvaux, and James France notes that Bernard was not the only non-Christ figure suckling Mary</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s milk as this became a &ldquo;widespread theme in collections of Marian miracle stories&rdquo; (McGuire 189-225, France </span><span class="c1">329</span><span class="c1">). Interestingly, the monk is not only cured or aided, but also learns to be a great preacher through the milk,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and in one 13th-century source the holy fluid allowed the monk to obtain a &ldquo;knowledge of letters.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Here, the Virgin is regarded as a divine figure, not a mediatrix who intervenes on the male worshipper</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s behalf to attain grace from the masculine divinity of the Father or the Son, and is able to also foster traditionally male knowledge of preaching and letters in the monk she blesses with her breast milk. This is certainly in line with the Cult of the Virgin popular through the Middle Ages and still arguably pursued in present-day Catholic tradition (especially in Latin America and the Philippines) which allowed for the persistent worship of the pre-Christian Earth Mother.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;What is significant is that the Virgin, despite her status as mother and thus embodied as female, still cultivates divine agency, which typically belongs within a masculine domain. The Virgin, having become pregnant and birthing a child miraculously, as well as being the only human after Christ</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s death to have not suffered a bodily death,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;reveals how the feminine can fit into the conception of the divine without becoming masculinized in some way. In her essay &ldquo;Stabat Mater,&rdquo; Julia Kristeva asks, &ldquo;If it is not possible to say of a </span><span class="c0">woman</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that she </span><span class="c0">is</span><span class="c1">..., would it perhaps be different concerning the </span><span class="c0">mother</span><span class="c1">, since that is the only function of the </span><span class="c1">&lsquo;</span><span class="c1">other sex</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;to which we can definitely attribute existence?&rdquo; (161). If not knowing man sexually, as Eve did, somehow precludes her from some construct of the feminine, then the expression of motherhood with its pregnancy and bodily nourishment of the infant must call her back into that domain. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">That domain of motherhood, however, is not reserved for women. Christ is frequently a nurturer, who literally provides sustenance to his followers through his body and blood via transubstantiation during every Catholic mass. If one were to argue that corporeality and nourishing were exclusive to a feminine expression of spirituality, in Christ exists the clear exception. Caroline Walker Bynum discusses the parallelism between the Virgin</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s breast and Christ</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s wound, compellingly arguing that the art historical record that positions Christ</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s wound close to the breast is purposeful and telling.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Like Mary, too, and noted by Augustine, he is positioned as &ldquo;Mediator of God and humanity, the man Jesus Christ,&rdquo; existing simultaneously in the earthly and spiritual realms (1 Tim 2:5).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">As the virgin son of God and the virgin Mary &mdash; a woman &mdash; Christ is without a flesh and blood direct male ancestor, rendering him to be something of a gender outsider.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We must keep in mind that historically, blood has at times been gendered, as James White notes, &ldquo;In medieval medical theory, blood was understood as the precursor to all other bodily fluids, including sperm and breast milk&rdquo; (167). Thus, when Catherine equates the fragrance of her blood to that of Niccol&ograve; di Toldo,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;she is suggesting that her blood is masculine rather than feminine. And for Christ, the opposite may well be true, as his human bloodlines are feminine, and as his blood is used in the production of a nourishing liquid. Catherine also constructs a &ldquo;female Christ,&rdquo; as F. Thomas Luongo has argued with regard to the language of Letter T273 that seems to reverse the traditional understanding of the Song of Songs, with Christ as the &ldquo;sweet bride&rdquo; who receives the masculine bridegroom soul in penetrative language (&ldquo;Catherine of Siena: Rewriting the Female Holy Authority&rdquo; 95-97).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Christ is in many ways tied to nourishing and motherhood, and though he can be complicated as a feminine figure, he is still often cast as masculine and thus decidedly outside of the traditional realm inhabited by female. Roland Barthes suggests a new conception of the maternal: &ldquo;Perhaps one should end up with this: ... no longer automatically confusing mother and woman. In which case, the androgyne would be any subject within whom there is something maternal&rdquo; (</span><span class="c1">194</span><sup><a href="#cmnt30" id="cmnt_ref30">[ad]</a></sup><span class="c1 c14">). It is therefore necessary to claim the maternal as outside of woman, and fitting with a shifting, inconstant or outlying gender identification.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In Kristeva</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s essay on the Virgin, she evokes not only milk but also tears as a non-verbal semiotics (174). While the milk is the symbol of nourishment, the mother</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s tears are an expression of a sorrowful humanity; as a mother one is the symbol of life who also functions as the veil of inevitable death. However, again, it is not only women and mothers who cry &mdash; Abraham weeps out of mourning for Sarah in Genesis 23:2, David weeps occasionally in the Books of Samuel, Christ weeps in John 11:35 and Hebrews 5:7, Peter weeps bitterly after denying Christ in Matthew 26:75, Gregory the Great introduced the phrase &ldquo;lacrymarum gratia&rdquo; in his 6th-century </span><span class="c0">Dialogues</span><span class="c1">, sorrowful tears and the tears of his mother are a recurring motif in Augustine</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s </span><span class="c0">Confessions</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that factor into his conversion, tears were an important aspect of medieval monastic life for men,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and hagiographical records of Francis of Assisi note that his copious tears contributed to his eventually becoming blind. Arguably, each of these cases of tears are expressing sorrowful humanity, and are also spiritual utterances that are not constrained by corporeal states of sex, sexuality, or gender. The tears of men may not cause one to question their masculinity, but they do complicate the gendering of these emotional performances as </span><span class="c1">ipso facto</span><sup><a href="#cmnt31" id="cmnt_ref31">[ae]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;feminine. Kristeva</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s nonvocal semiotics of the mother can be extended to be part of a mystical semiotics that exists outside of speech and written word (as in Francis</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s case), but should not be limited in its conscription to the domain of womanhood, as mothering and its expressions are not bound to a singular </span><span class="c1">gender</span><sup><a href="#cmnt32" id="cmnt_ref32">[af]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt33" id="cmnt_ref33">[ag]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt34" id="cmnt_ref34">[ah]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The figure of the virgin, who is determinedly outside of sexuality, and typically does not participate in the expression of motherhood as in Kristeva</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c14 c1">s discussion of Mary, is even less easily gendered. For many, the virgin is in a privileged gender space, especially when the virgin is a woman. For many thinkers, the female virgin is so esteemed that she is rendered man. The Church Father, Jerome wrote, &ldquo;long as women is for birth and children, she is as different from man as body is from soul. But when she wishes to serve Christ more than the world, then she will cease to be a woman and will be called man&rdquo; (Bullough 227). Jerome utilizes the theological &nbsp;dichotomy of body and soul to compare the state of woman and man, aligning women with a corporeal material state and men with a transcendent divine-reaching state. However, women who choose not to engage with what many of the pre-modern period would believe to be their biological destiny, can transcend their flesh-oriented state, and rather than produce more of humanity, can approach God. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">However, some Christian thinkers situate virginity as outside of a binary construction of gender. In an illustrated account of her mystical visions from the 12th century, the </span><span class="c0">Scivias</span><span class="c1">, Hildegard puts forth that married sexual life can be a fine choice for a Christian when done with care, but the corporeal state of virginity would always be preferable. Throughout her writing, she conflates &ldquo;virginitas&rdquo; with &ldquo;viriditas&rdquo; (greenness) and &ldquo;virilitas&rdquo; (virility) &mdash; for Hildegard and her contemporaries, words were valid signifiers for that which they signified. Thus, the virgin is a green and ripening fruit that pulls its power from the sun, rendering greenness to be a vital force that can be easily reconciled with the notion of virility. With these similarities in mind, both male and female &ldquo;green&rdquo; virgins prove to be not only virile, but the most virile of humans as virginity has more viridity (thus virility) integral to it than any other state of being. Indeed, in her </span><span class="c0">Symphonia</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">no. 19, Hildegard refers to the female-bodied Virgin Mary as &ldquo;viridissima </span><span class="c1">virga</span><sup><a href="#cmnt35" id="cmnt_ref35">[ai]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt36" id="cmnt_ref36">[aj]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt37" id="cmnt_ref37">[ak]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt38" id="cmnt_ref38">[al]</a></sup><span class="c1">,&rdquo; a phrase that encompasses several distinct meanings. Literally, the phase translates to &ldquo;greenest branch,&rdquo; while also connoting &ldquo;greenest rod,&rdquo; which can refer to the male sexual organ. Because the word &ldquo;virga&rdquo; is so close to the word &ldquo;virgo,&rdquo; the literal word for &ldquo;virgin&rdquo; is also conflated with the phrase&rsquo;s meaning. The ambiguity places the idea of the virgin in an undefined and multimodal space that inhabits the tension of virile sexuality and lack thereof. The male-bodied virginal Saint Rupert of Bingen is described as</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;dulcis viriditas pomis&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(no. 49, 4a), a &ldquo;vas nobile / quod non est pollutum,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and a &ldquo;sarcina sine medulla&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">(no. 49, 4b). Rupert is a green fruit, and a container that is both unsoiled and lightness, suggesting a lack of sexuality in both figurative and physical terms. Though Maud Burnett McInerney argues that Hildegard represents Rupert through a &ldquo;feminization of his body,&rdquo; it seems to me that Hildegard is actually working to position the virgin within a separate class in and of itself (</span><span class="c1">149</span><span class="c14 c1">). That is, the greenness that Hildegard describes is not in some way aligned with femininity, or even masculinity despite its connection to virility, but exists as an especially virile condition that is amplified for having been taken out of a sexual economy and gender. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The figures of the mystic as well and the saint, whether virgin or not, are also in many ways beyond gender, just as they remain as individuals outside of the political life of society. Employing shifting subjectivity throughout her text </span><span class="c0">Das fliessende Licht</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the beguine mystic Mechthild of Magdeburg has the allegorical Lady Knowledge instruct the soul: &ldquo;You are a virile man in battle, a well-dressed virgin in the palace before your Lord, and a joyous bride in your bed with God&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt43" id="ftnt_ref43">[43]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(II.19). That is, the figure of the mystic is man, virgin, and bride all at once &mdash; alternately courageous and pugnacious, courtly, ecstatic. With all of the recasting of gender in Song of Songs by religious thinkers, it is interesting to consider that in the </span><span class="c0">Legenda aurea</span><span class="c1">, Jacobus de Voragine describes Saint Sebastian as the saddle in between Christ-the-horseman and Church-the-horse. Though Sebastian has recently become an iconic saint for the LGBTQ community due to frequent homoerotic paintings of his martyrdom throughout art history,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Voragine was likely not consciously depicting Sebastian as inhabiting a third gender between the presumably masculine Christ and presumably feminine Church, though the imagery is decidedly sexual. Not only does Voragine evoke the Song of Songs,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;but horseback riding as well, which was typically understood to be a metaphor for sexual relations throughout the medieval period.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;In occupying the space between the masculine and the feminine, as the saddle between horse and rider, Sebastian can skillfully negotiate both spaces, or else be entirely outside either. Famously penetrated by all those arrows as one of his trials of martyrdom, Sebastian can occupy the positionality of the sexual female, while simultaneously holding military rank, which was traditionally reserved for the masculine domain. Though not described as a mystic, throughout his saintly life, Sebastian exemplifies the complicated gendering of the religious figure, which is even more problematized when the religious figure is also engaging with mysticism. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Mystics in particular reject many of the traditional and typically masculine forms of Christian worship: the desert fathers and mothers rejected all societal and gendered context by separating themselves from civilization, cloistered and anchorite mystics separated themselves from society at large and the gender binary more specifically, and itinerant mystics like Catherine chose to live unconventional lives that were unattached to norms imposed by gender roles. As </span><span class="c1">Bonaventure</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;writes, the Franciscans prayed not on ecclesiastical books and did not chant the canonical hours, but prayed humbly to the Cross of Christ and </span><span class="c1">on all things</span><sup><a href="#cmnt39" id="cmnt_ref39">[am]</a></sup><span class="c1">, suggesting that they were not interested in praying in a learned and erudite manner (which would have been limited to male Christians at the time) (IV, 3). Further, Bonaventure explains how the Franciscans believed that to achieve grace, one should renounce the wisdom of the world as well as his knowledge of letters, and thus dispossessed of such inheritance to go naked to the Lord (VII, 2). This teaching, which is certainly in keeping with Francis</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s own biographical experience of renouncing his earthly possessions and father&rsquo;s profession by rendering himself naked in a piazza of Assisi,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;rings true for all mystics &mdash; without the accoutrements of clothing and societal performance, these figures are without gender, class or societal status, and are instead like the </span><span class="c0">homo sacer</span><span class="c14 c1">. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Many mystics &mdash; more than denying themselves clothes, educational capital, belongings, and manneristic performance &mdash; tried to deny themselves of their body as well. Though Caroline Walker Bynum and Rudolph M. Bell discuss the many holy women who denied themselves food,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and the fasting Catherine would also limit her sleep to half an hour out of every period of two days, bodily denial was not limited to feminine spiritual practices. Hair shirts and flagellation were typical expressions of corporeal mortification and suffering across gender, whether to prevent sexual urges or in an attempt to no longer feel the body at all. In addition to sleeping on hard surfaces and a diet devoid of meat and cooked vegetables, in one hagiographic episode, Francis flees to the cold snow outside to dispel his desires. Writing on Spanish mystics including Juan de los &Aacute;ngeles and John of the Cross, Maureen Flynn explains how negating the temporally-bound body proved to be a means to fully incorporate the soul more purely with God, allowing the individual</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s core of the immortal soul to rid itself of sensory and mental faculties to transcend (&ldquo;The Spiritual Uses of Pain in Spanish Mysticism&rdquo;). This is to say, that even if we do not follow Judith Butler</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c14 c1">s view that sex is just as much of a construction as gender is, these practices show that not only are mystics divorcing themselves from gender but they are trying to remove themselves from corporality: going naked to the Lord means ridding oneself not just of clothes but of the body as well. Mystics are working to exist on the Earth just as they eventually will in Paradise, as genderless, sexless, body-less immortal creatures of God. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c1">Although religious and holy figures engage with many of the same negotiations of sex, gender, and social status that mystics do, the mystic is in a special situation due to their direct access to God. As Helen Rolfson writes (128):</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1">The mystic speaks of God as of the partner in dialogue. What is said about one is reflected mirror-wise in the other&hellip; The prayers of Catherine of Siena beautifully demonstrate this reciprocity&hellip; As William of St. Thierry puts it: &ldquo;True friendship either finds or creates equals.&rdquo; No friendship is based on inequality. The mystic is very aware that that offer of divine friendship has been extended to one who is anything but God</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c14 c1">s equal. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Though mystics do not perceive themselves to be the equal to God, they see themselves to be a </span><span class="c1">partner and a friend</span><sup><a href="#cmnt40" id="cmnt_ref40">[an]</a></sup><span class="c1">, which is a condition that approaches God unlike any other state of being. The unique relationship between mystic and God is often viewed as one in which the mystic serves as a conduit for God</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s word, but, as Rolfson suggests, it proves to be more of a working and reciprocal partnership. And indeed, as Barbara Newman explains, often the mystic forgets the difference between the creature and the Creator, and &ldquo;behaves as an equal&rdquo; (144). Within this practice, the mystic</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;conversations with God and the resulting writing that documents these dialogues act as another space in which the mystic serves to mediate. The mystic channels God&rsquo;s direct teaching, filters it through her experience and knowledge, and then releases it as a means to teach and nurture others. The language, as we will explore, is bound by earthly literary conventions and reveals the agency that the mystic has in her relationship to God&rsquo;s word. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a partnership, of course, is the union with God that all religious followers experience to some degree, but which mystics more palpably participate in, through mystical marriages and spiritual transpositions. Catherine of Siena marries Christ, exchanges her &nbsp;corporeal heart with his, wears his foreskin for a ring,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;relates how her name is interchanged with Christ&rsquo;s by Niccol&ograve; di Toldo,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and carries out God&rsquo;s work in public spaces throughout her life. She is not alone, as Catherine of Alexandria, Teresa of &Agrave;vila, Rose of Lima, Francisco de Hoyos y </span><span class="c1">Sena</span><sup><a href="#cmnt41" id="cmnt_ref41">[ao]</a></sup><span class="c1">, and many others also experienced a mystical wedding, and still more wrote prayers and sermons on marriage with Christ.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt51" id="ftnt_ref51">[51]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Similarly, others take the place of Christ in certain instances: the martyrs suffer and sacrifice themselves as Christ did, Bernard of Clairvaux drinks Mary&rsquo;s milk in the place of the infant Jesus; Margaret and other saints literally and allegorically beat the devil as God does in the Bible. Origen </span><span class="c0">adimantios</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;writes on the role of the soul as a mother to Jesus: &ldquo;And every soul, virgin and uncorrupted, which conceives by the Holy Spirit, so as to give birth to the Will of the Father, is the Mother of Jesus,&rdquo; thus emphasizing the constantly in-flux relationships between Mary and Christ, the soul and Mary, and the soul and Christ (Comm. on Mt. frg. 281 [GCS Origen 12.1:126.10-15]).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt52" id="ftnt_ref52">[52]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;In commenting particularly on a pure soul, which is virginal and uncorrupted, Origen is limiting his pool of Christian followers dramatically, and speaks to the complicated role of the Virgin Mary, and the concept of the virgin as a figure that is on the peripheries of gender and in conflict with itself in many ways &mdash; at once a virgin and a mother. Moreover, Teresa of &Aacute;vila notes in her writing that she lived only through God being within her;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt53" id="ftnt_ref53">[53]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;the missionary mystical writer Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza appropriates Christ&rsquo;s voice, and Angela de Foligno identified with Christ throughout her writing (Cruz 133-136). In many ways the mystic is not only married with God, but combined with him, and more often with the Son of God specifically, exchanging body parts, voices, and positions with him. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The union with God, whether it is perceived as the result of a mystical marriage or not, leads to another positionality that is difficult to locate. Jacopone da Todi writes of the union with God as a loss of self, tempering it paradoxically with some semblance of maintained subjectivity on the part of the soul who is both conquering and conquered: &ldquo;The form that has been given you by God has absorbed you in such a way that you live although you are dead, both conqueror and conquered&rdquo; (Laud 91, as quoted in </span><span class="c0">The Flowering of Mysticism</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;130). </span><span class="c1">Hadewijch</span><sup><a href="#cmnt42" id="cmnt_ref42">[ap]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;uses similar contradictory language of the union between the mortal soul and the divine in a letter (</span><span class="c0">Letter</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">IX</span><span class="c1">)&nbsp;,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c14 c1">From the depths of his wisdom, he shall teach you what he is and with what wonderful sweetness the one lover lives in the other and so permeates the other that they do not know themselves from each other. But they possess each other in mutual delight, mouth in mouth, heart in heart, body in body, soul in soul, while a single divine nature flows through them both and they both become one through each other, yet remaining always themselves.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">In this description, there is a knowledge that is cultivated through the union &mdash; not a knowledge of letters (though one may gain that from Mary&rsquo;s breast milk), but a certain sweet and spiritual wisdom. Hadewijch blends imagery from the Song of Songs with more equitable ideas about marriage than what may have been available at the time of her writing: two lovers who are one yet maintain their own identity. Quoting William of St. Thierry, Bernard McGinn writes, &ldquo;The mystical life consists of an ongoing oscillation between [ ... ] two stages &mdash; &lsquo;...the man of God ought to be always either rational in seeking or spiritual in loving&rsquo;&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0">The Growth of Mysticism</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;235). The &ldquo;man&rdquo; of God is always finding himself in a fluctuating position, shifting between not just two stages of rationality (an earthly state) and spirituality, but constantly negotiating among many different registers that are coded as human, divine and other. Like the recluses of Siena in the 13th and 14th centuries, the mystic is on the peripheries of the city, at its edges like the </span><span class="c0">homo sacer</span><span class="c14 c1">. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine, straddling many boundaries, manifests her identity in multifold ways. As a virile woman, she describes herself, the Pope, and her companions as knights on the battlefield fighting for the Church, with Christ leading the way. This militaristic imagery is employed in both her </span><span class="c0">Dialogo</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;(chapter 77) and in several of her letters, including T128 addressed to Gabriele di Davino Piccolomini, a married Sienese noble, in late 1377:</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c1">In questo modo noi, che siamo posti nel campo a combattere contro li nostri nemici, cio&egrave; contra il mondo, la carne e &rsquo;l dimonio, senza l&#39;arme non potremmo combattere, n&egrave; ricevere li colpi che non ci offendessero. Che arme dunque &egrave; quella che ci conviene avere? Di coltello. Convienti anco avere la corazza della vera carit&agrave;, la quale ripara e&rsquo; colpi, che ci d&agrave; il mondo indiversi modi, e a molte tentazioni del dimonio, e a&rsquo; colpi della nostra fragilit&agrave;, che impugna contra lo spirito, come detto &egrave;.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Catherine, as a knight among many others, casts herself in a way that is not unlike the figure of Joan of Arc, a Christian soldier who is fighting with a double-edged knife that serves to uphold charity and work against human frailty in the face of temptation. Raymond, too, acknowledges Catherine&rsquo;s self-positioning as a woman who is virile and armed. When describing her mystical marriage to Christ, he writes that God says, &ldquo;Age igitur filia viriliter amodo absque cunctatione quacumque illa, que ordinante mea providentia tuas deducentur ad manus, quia fortitudine fidei iam armata cunctos tibi adversantes feliciter superabis&rdquo; (I.12.4).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;Catherine will act in a virile manner without hesitation because she is armed with the strength of her faith and will overcome her adversaries. Again, she is cast as a knight going out to battle and not a cloistered woman, even when describing her mystical marriage which one may expect to be in a more heteronormative register. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On expressions of monasticism in Europe, Theodora A. Jankowski writes that there are two primary traditions for religious expression, that of the </span><span class="c0">miles</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or soldier who battled Satan on Christ&rsquo;s behalf, and that of the </span><span class="c0">sponsa</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or bride of Christ, unified with him through love (62). What, she argues, is significant is that these two possibilities are &ldquo;interchangeable in terms of gender. A male virgin could be considered a </span><span class="c0">sponsa</span><span class="c1">; a female virgin could be considered a </span><span class="c0">miles</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&hellip; genderless images of the soldier and bride of Christ allowed [female monastics] to act in the same way as male monastics&rdquo; (62-63). Existing in a way that can conflate traditions allows religious figures, both male and female, to occupy spaces that were reserved for what society considered the opposite sex. In her book </span><span class="c0">Tendencies</span><span class="c14 c1">, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick writes (8), </span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c14 c1">That&rsquo;s one of the things that &ldquo;queer&rdquo; can refer to: the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone&rsquo;s gender, of anyone&rsquo;s sexuality aren&rsquo;t made (or can&rsquo;t be made) to signify monolithically.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Queerness allows for greater possibilities, enabling individuals to fill in gaps, create opportunities for lapses, and exist in multiple fluctuating places within a spectrum of gender or sexuality. Catherine, and many other mystics, took advantage of the conflation of &ldquo;dissonances and resonances&rdquo; within their respective communities. Because the idea of the </span><span class="c0">sponsa</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c0">miles</span><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;resonated so successfully as symbols for monastic life, both male and female religious were able to occupy those spaces, despite the dissonances between genders in a binary society.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jankowski&rsquo;s project is around the notion of queer virginity, and is a good place to consider the recasting of mystics as they often exist as virgins in their natural lives (6-7):</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c14 c1">I have chosen to use the term &ldquo;queer&rdquo; to define or categorize the position of the adult virgin primarily because of the inclusivity of the term &hellip; focus[sing] on the way in which the notion of &ldquo;queer&rdquo; or &ldquo;queerness&rdquo; allows a space for examining issues of sexuality that are not restricted to the binary axis of homo- versus heterosexuality.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c14 c1">Since virgins are outside of what is a binary sexual landscape, they are queer. From Jankowski&rsquo;s work, I would like to expand this definition. Including celibates is an obvious move, but I contend that queerness can exist outside of a definition of sexuality, and carry over to expressions of gender and expressions of otherness in more general terms. Heather Webb writes on the masculinity of the heart in medieval literature, discussing how writers like Catherine and Dante can allow for masculinity across variously sexed bodies (138-9):</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c14 c1">For Catherine, as for Dante, the gendered notion of vital heat and its association with the capacity for outward propulsions does not enforce a limiting binary. This idea of gender relies on gradation or continuum, allowing for a significant amount of play in the temperatures and extrusive or projective power associated with the sexes. The concept of the heat of the heart allowed these writers to reevaluate the key characteristic of masculinity as a quality that was derived from virtue, from the reception of divine gifts within the body, and from the desire to pull something forth in response to that gift &mdash; to give back.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c14 c1">In styling masculinity as an aspect from virtue, Catherine can occupy the space of masculinity, claiming it as a quality that she possesses. She is both soldier and bride of Christ, existing across a spectrum of identity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c14 c1">In her article &ldquo;Orientations: Toward a Queer Phenomenology,&rdquo; Sara Ahmed defines the act of queering as such (565):</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c14 c1">To make things queer is certainly to disturb the order of things. The effects of such disturbance are uneven, given that the world is already organized around certain forms of living &mdash; certain times, spaces, and directions. It is important to make the oblique angles of queer do this work, even if it risks placing different kinds of queer effects alongside each other.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c14 c1">Queering disturbs the order of things. Catherine, as someone marked as woman, inhabiting various edges of society &mdash; located in spaces that are not typically authorized for someone of her sex, class, education level &mdash; disturbs the order of things. She acts as a soldier, as a bride, has a masculine heart beating in her chest, claims a grassroots education, achieves literacy, writes to people in positions of power, preaches in piazzas, empowers the disenfranchised in her city. Claiming power through an intimate relationship with the divine, and existing in a space between this world and the next, she is disturbing established hierarchies, using her own self-knowledge, mystically-obtained knowledge, and community-based knowledge to, in time, become a sanctioned teacher of the Church. And Catherine is not alone in this impulse &mdash; many mystics throughout history, as described above, work to disturb the order of things.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The mystic is a borderless figure, gendered queer and an amalgamation between nature and divine, fluctuating between a this-worldly direction and an other-worldly focus. Like the Latin American figure of Santa Muerte, a skeleton saint who travels beyond borders with migrants who carry her and is considered to be at once folkloristic as well as holy, the mystics operate within a similar space: by being sacred they are othered. Nomadic, whether by being an earthly itinerant preacher or a divinely transcendent anchorite, the mystic passes through borders freely yet is bound by them, and persists as a figure of tension that holds &ldquo;incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true,&rdquo; paradoxically shifting between rational language and erotically charged spiritual language, the sense of being nothing and everything at once in union with, yet separate from God (Haraway 161). In her &ldquo;Manifesto,&rdquo; Donna Haraway writes, &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Cyborgs</span><sup><a href="#cmnt43" id="cmnt_ref43">[aq]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt44" id="cmnt_ref44">[ar]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt45" id="cmnt_ref45">[as]</a></sup><span class="c14 c1">&nbsp;might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment,&rdquo; and, moreover, the queer cybernetic mystic might consider the partial, fluid, and sometimes-state of mortality and immortality, human and non-human (as they approach divinity), within and without (180). A paradoxical figure, the mystic, like the texts that they leave behind, operates within the periphery: between and among, folklore and canon, erudite and wise yet uneducated and sensing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Returning to Freud</span><span class="c1">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s claim that &ldquo;Mysticism is the obscure self-perception of the realm outs</span><span class="c1">i</span><span class="c1">de the ego, of the id,&rdquo; and considering that the id also dominates psychological development prior to the phallic stage of sexual awareness and gender expression, it is possible to see how mystics are working outside of a sexual economy, outside of gender, and outside of typically human forms of consciousness. In her lyrical text, </span><span class="c0">Teresa, My Love</span><span class="c14 c1">, on the mystic Teresa of &Agrave;vila, Kristeva really gets to the heart of the situation of the mystic (26):</span></p><p class="c9 c13"><span class="c14 c1">Hail Teresa, borderless woman, &hellip; made word, made flesh, who unravels inside and outside herself, ... too much body yet disembodied, beyond matter, ... throbbing for the Beloved ever-present and yet never there, ...
