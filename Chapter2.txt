Dante and Petrarch, famed courtly love poets, are among the most successful 14th-century Italian writers. Their work is still counted among the most canonical of Italian literature, while having also been among the first ventures and earliest innovations of vernacular writing. Though she is also writing as one of the founders of the Italian literary tradition, Catherine is more often relegated to religious or political rather than literary status (as discussed above). However, she uses language, themes and constructions markedly similar to that of Petrarch and Dante. While each of these texts participate in different communities, appeal to different audiences, and serve various and diverse purposes,  the primary vernacular texts of each author — Dante’s Commedia, Petrarch’s Rime sparse, and Catherine’s Dialogo — show overlaps of diction, topic, and word frequency. This suggests that the work being done by each of these authors is operating within a particular context, and that there is a certain amount of exchange between these different forms and styles of writing (i.e. mystical and lyrical writing), which is not merely one-directional.
Franco Moretti, in theorizing world literature and arguing against canon-based close reading, makes a case for “distant reading:” “where distance, let me repeat it, is a condition of knowledge: it allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, tropes — or genres and systems” (49). If we are to recover missing voices from the canon, who have been overlooked due to their marginalized status (be that due to gender, race, religion, economic status, etc.), it becomes imperative to employ new methods of entering into analytical and theoretical discourse. Utilizing a quantitative approach enabled through digital humanities statistical computations can allow readers to look at Catherine’s texts in light of her fellow Italian vernacular innovators that are within the literary canon. 
When applying a digital humanities computational-driven methodology to explore texts, especially those written prior to moveable type that exist in various iterations across manuscript editions, one must bear in mind statistician George E. P. Box’s warning: “Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful” (424). Applying modes of reading texts — in the humanities writ large or statistical models via digital humanities techniques — is subject to careful analysis, and each method is merely another way of “getting at” a text; not a definitive answer. This is why Moretti’s proposal for “distant reading” can prove useful, as using machines to read texts can provide this wider perspective as a counter-balance to close reading. My inquiry into Catherine’s writing brings together computer-based textual analysis and traditional humanistic examination to see a more robust account of her writing and its context. My digital humanities approach uses both statistical word counts and topic models based on a machine learning algorithm trained on a corpus of available 13th-century Italian texts, all of which are visualized so as to be readily accessible. A full technical description of my digital approach and relevant source code and command line printouts are available in the Appendix.
It is worth noting that the Dialogo represents the largest corpus by far with 143,906 words, with the Commedia and the Rime sparse containing 101,602 and 57,154 words respectively. Among these three texts, there are 21,549 unique words out of 302,662 words total (7% of the words are unique), and the text with the most vocabulary density is the Commedia, with the Dialogo being the least dense. Dante and Petrarch are much more likely to use variations on the same word in order to fit rhyme schemes and syllabic constraints, and it is up to the analyzer to choose whether or not to render “amore” and “amor” as the same word. In most cases, I chose to have words count differently unless I specify otherwise. These variations of the same word, however, likely cause the density of vocabulary of their texts. Certain words trend throughout the three texts, with notable peaks in frequency occurring across the corpora: “vero” (peak at the end), “anime” (peak at the end), “cielo” (peak in the middle), “etterna” (peak at the end), “misericordia” (peak at the end). The three texts analyzed together reveal a frequent use of words throughout them, including “amore,” “lume,” “desiderio,” “dolce,” “occhio/occhi.” When considering Catherine’s Dialogo alone, along with the words above, “anima” and “virtù” carry more weight. The Rime sparse favors words like “bel,” “ben,” “cor” (not combined with “cuore”), “donna,” “morte” and “sol.” The Commedia utilizes words like “ben,” “disse,” “fuor” and “terra” more frequently. As Dante’s Paradiso works in similar ways to mystical writing, I performed a separate analysis on this canticle (here I changed all instances of “amore” to “amor”), and when compared with the Dialogo, we can see that many words are frequently used across both texts, with “amor”/”amore” and “lume” among the most often used words, and other words and categories of words related to Christ, the mind and consciousness, corporality and nature, and seeing all being shared across the two texts.
To further see the categories of words and themes that these texts are dealing with, topic modeling analysis was performed across all of the texts mentioned above as well as Catherine’s collection of letters. While stop word lists included personal pronouns for the word frequency analysis, I reinstated them for topic modeling as they would no longer overwhelm the sample sizes. Topic modeling is a means to computationally detect the close proximity of words that renders frequent clusters of words called topics, and the full topic modeling analysis of these texts is in the Appendix. Between the Paradiso and the Dialogo in particular, the topic with the most weight shares similar words (in bold), with “amore,” “bene,” “grazia,” “lume,” and the personal pronoun “mio” making up its strongest topic:
 
Paradiso:
mia mio amor occhi ben lui dio luce lume ciel vidi mente lor sol donna beatrice veder lei grazia natura
Dialogo:
loro amore anima virtú veritá lume mio corpo pena bene sangue grazia desiderio decto figliuolo affecto morte sancta dio miei
 
This data suggests that lyric poetry and mystical writing may well inform each other, and that Catherine’s writing, far from being unlearned, is actively engaging with the larger linguistic world of her time. 


Like mystics who have proven to be master practitioners of shifting subjectivities, the writers of courtly love poetry also negotiate their relative subjectivity and objectivity in relation to their lover. Using amorous and erotic language to do so, they simultaneously contemplate virtue and the loss of self, just as mystic writers do. Though theorists like Beauvoir have argued that mystics, inherently feminine, have been informed by their experience of love and love poetry because they have not been able to function within another domain, here I would like to suggest that there is an exchange—not a one-directional influence—between mystic writing and love poetry. Love poetry generally borrows language from religious writing (the loved lady as the Sun, for example), but is typically thought to eroticize the religious language; and some have argued that the Song of Songs is the solitary gateway for religious and erotic language to mingle together. But mystical writing, while also informed by the Song of Songs, has had a long-standing tradition of erotically-charged language used as a means to access knowledge in general and sacred knowledge in particular. The tradition of love poetry that comes out of courtly love, and of which I will consider Catherine’s fellow Italian vernacular writers, similarly uses erotic language as an avenue to knowledge of love, knowledge of metaphysics (as with Guido Cavalcanti), and knowledge of God.
In the chapter “Vernacular Voices of the Donna: Pisa” in Reclaiming Catherine of Siena, Jane Tylus writes of the significance of the Italian preference for the courtly word donna rather than the more biological femmina for “woman,” which persists to this day, no doubt because of Dante’s usage though he is not the first to use the word in love poetry addressed to the lady. Catherine herself makes the distinction between the two words: femmina as weak, donna as cultivating strength and will. Donna, derived from the Latin word domina, is the feminine noun counterpart to Domine, a word for God. In literal terms, domine is lord and donna is lady, with all the undertones of King Arthur’s court. As Tylus argues, the word lady is not typically employed more than woman in other languages, for example, the French preferring femme over dame. Though it is interesting that Dante’s diction has been so compelling and influential to the Italian language over time, the use of donna in courtly love poetry reveals the play with subjectivity inherent in these texts. By instilling so much force in the word used for the beloved, granting her a domain and a queendom regardless of her social status—even perhaps suggestive a feminine god—the masculine lover-speaker mitigates his own power in linguistic terms, often of course significant to the meaning of the poetry.
There has certainly been a lot of feminist criticism around troubadour poetry and the subsequent courtly love poetry that developed in the Italian language first in the Sicilian court of Frederick II (the Sicilian School), then through to the Tuscan School and Dante’s own cohort of the dolce stil novo. Though it can be argued that the elevated position of the female beloved in relation to the male pursuer can be seen as progressive, even patronizing, it is also possible to read the texts not as a binary representation of a masculine knight-errant pursuing an inaccessible feminine lover, but as a negotiation of several power hierarchies in an amorous relationship. For each poet, these dynamics play out differently, and in poetry cycles much can be shifted. While Beatrice is known to be the virtuous and lofty unattainable woman in Dante’s love poetry, Dante also presents a very different woman and very different speaker-lover in his Rime petrose cycle. “La crudele.” Here the stone woman may be the more powerful one in the relationship, as Dante also does depict Beatrice, but the Donna Pietra is not virtuous and seems to be the aggressor who overtakes the fleeing speaker-lover. In the last of the four poems, “Così nel mio parlar voglio esser aspro,” rape imagery and the notion of eros as revenge are intersected with imagery of the liturgical hours (66-73): 
S’io avessi le belle trecce prese,
che fatte son per me scudiscio e ferza,
pigliandole anzi terza,
con essere passerei vespero e squille:
e non sarei pietoso né cortese,
anzi farei com’orso quando scerza;
e se Amor me ne sferza,
io mi vendicherei di più di mille. [1]
The imagery of the bear is from an old proverb: if you don't want to get bitten, don't play with a bear. Here the speaker-lover expects a violent sex act on the part of both parties. The church bells show the passage of night, but they also lend a sacred sense to the representation, especially considering that Dante brings imagery from this poem into Paradiso XXVI (discussed below).
Before delving further into the courtly love poetry, let us consider the Beguine mystic writing that Barbara Newman describes as “la mystique courtoise.” She argues that Beguine mystical writers — Hadewijch, Mechthild, Marguerite Porete — experiment with polyvalent subjectivity, sometimes as the beloved bride of Christ the bridegroom and sometimes as the knight-errant longing for his/her faraway beloved. Hadewijch, for example, twins “I” and “she” in her lyric poetry, “indistinguishable from the troubadour’s,” and even pretends to abandon love and spurn her beloved, which “only initiates will recognize … as God” (148). Beguine mysticism adopted both the monastic allegorical tradition surrounding the Song of Songs as well as a courtly love tradition: “In combination, the two discourses may reinforce each other or they may work at cross-purposes, almost incidentally conferring dual gender on both the lover and the divine Beloved” (138). I would add that it is not just the mystics who are combining the two threads of Song of Songs subjectivity-shifting monasticism and courtly love, for how else can Dante bring erotic language into Paradiso?
Even in the writing of the poet considered the most secular of the dolce stil novo group, Guido Cavalcanti, donna (again, related to domine) is employed throughout his poetry (the famous “Donna me prega” is considered here in particular), displacing power from the masculine speaker to the feminine beloved. Unlike some of his contemporary poets, Cavalcanti’s beloved is not depicted as cruel, stingy with her love, nor is she in any way punished for her power over him; instead he is a willing servant to her and happy to suffer for his love. This resembles the mystic’s relation to God, as the mystic is always full of love and ready to serve her lord. As Dana Stewart explains, the donna is equipped with the Platonic model of active eyes, while the speaker has the Aristotelian model of passive eyes (49). The words for eyes (occhi) and other vision-based words including light (lume), are used throughout love poetry and mystical writing; Cavalcanti, who writes in a very philosophical manner, uses these terms as they relate to the science of optics, as he was aware of it in his time. In discussing Cavalcanti within the theoretical cinematic model of the male gaze, Stewart writes, “The poet-lover exerts no controlling gaze over her [his beloved],” revealing his relative subordinance to the beloved (54). Intellectually, as will be discussed below, Cavalcanti is unable to grasp the image of his beloved, which further demonstrates his lack of power in relation to the woman who exists in an ineffable state.
In both mystical and courtly love writing, shifting subjectivities are constantly in flux, as they are in Catherine’s writing. While Beguine mystics may often operate within a traditional role reversal with Christ as love object, Dante and other Italian poets depict throughout their texts a negotiation between the one who is the beloved and the lover. Catherine transposes relations so that she is the one that God is after instead, as can be seen in the Dialogo as well as her Orazioni: 
...o pazzo d’amore! Hai tu bisogno della tua creatura? Sì, a quanto mi pare; parché tu tieni dei modi, come se tu non potessi vivere senza di lei, sabbene tu sia vita, da cui ogni cosa ha vita, e senza di te nessuna cosa vive. Perché dunque sei così impazzito? Perché tu tinnamorasti della tua fattura, ti compiacesti e dilettasti in te medesimo di lei, e, come inebriato della sua salute, la vai cercando, mentre ella ti fugge? Ella si allontana, e tu ti appressi a lei; non potevi venire più vicino, che vestendoti della sua umanità (Dialogo 153).[2]


O amore ineffabile, benché nella tua luce tu vedessi tutte le iniquità che la tua creatura doveva commettere contro la tua infinita bontà, tu hai come fatto finta di non vedere, e hai fermato lo sguardo sulla bellezza della tua creatura, della quale tu, come pazzo ed ebbro d’amore, ti sei innamorato, e per amore l’hai tratta da te dandole l’essere a tua immagine e somiglianza. Tu, verità eterna, hai dichiarato a me la tua verità, cioè che è stato l’amore a costringerti a crearla; benché tu vedessi che ti doveva offendere, la tua carità non ha voluto che tu fermassi l’occhio in questo vedere, ma al contrario hai distolto i tuoi occhi da questa offesa che doveva avvenire e li hai fermati sulla bellezza della creatura. Se tu avessi fermato lo sguardo in quell’offesa, avresti dimenticato l’amore che avevi per creare l’uomo. E non ti fu nascosto questo, ma ti sei fermato all’amore, perché tu non sei altro che fuoco d’amore, pazzo della tua creatura  (Orazione 4).[3]
Catherine depicts God as a sort of Pygmalion figure in love with his creation — not only in love, but madly and drunkenly and crazily in love[4] with her (Catherine uses creatura, a feminine noun, but she also refers to his creation as uomo). She talks about love as ineffable, a metaphor for self knowledge, and also of his beloved straying from the pursuing love, an allegory of the sinning human escaping God. She discusses God becoming man in Christ, and how that resolves some of the lovers’ tension, though man will always be expected to sin. The prayer in particular speaks to God’s not giving up on his creation—the errant knight who ceaselessly pursues his beloved.
Love poetry is often thought of as an exchange between two individuals, or even just the solitary writing of one party to another disinterested one (as the act of writing itself is often conflated with working alone). However courtly love poetry is inherently part of a larger community: the court. As Newman explains, the amorous couple are never truly alone and are alway enveloped by friends, foes, or jealous members of the court. She writes (142),
A fulfilled relationship could overcome the solipsism of immature lovers and blossom into what Chrétien de Troyes called the Joy of the Court. In his Erec et Énide, high festival is held when mature lovers also achieve the integration of private desire with social responsibility. 
That is, there is an assimilation of the private to the public within courtly love, which is also a topos for the mystic; this Newman demonstrates in her discussion of the Beguine mystic in particular. The mystic is surrounded by spiritual friends and is often in the position of sharing her bridegroom of Christ with them. In states of ecstasy, the mystic is often with others, dictating her experience to scribes, thus making a very private and erotic affair an aspect of the wider spiritual community of which she is part. While some cloistered or otherwise reclusive mystics, like Hildegard, are members of a much smaller community (though certainly still a community nonetheless), mystics like Catherine who are part of society invariably have social responsibility as a larger aspect of their mysticism and love with Christ. Therefore, in a figure like Catherine, the topos of community within courtly love is particularly strong, and she must not consider just herself and her lover alone but all the societal implications as an aspect of her mystical experiences and writing.
A typical component of courtly love is the giving of gifts and their joyful reception by the lady. Though generally the gifts that Christ and God bestow upon the mystics are the virtues (charity, chastity), or tribulations such as poverty and illness,[5] Catherine (and a few other women who experienced mystical marriages with Christ) did receive a ruby ring from her beloved. A jewel, visible only to herself, is in much stricter keeping with courtly love motifs and plotlines. Further, the exchange of hearts between lovers is the utmost expression of passion in courtly love poetry, and though this is usually expressed in metaphorical terms, with one of the two parties expressing to the other that they have full control over the other’s heart, in mysticism this exchange of hearts can be quite literal. According to Raymond, Catherine herself exchanged hearts with Christ, with her heart beating inside his body and Christ’s heart contained within her body for three days. Heather Webb notes that this exchange is not depicted within Catherine’s own writing,[6] but another example of literal heart exchange is also present in the mystic writing of Lutgardis in the early 13th century. Though the motif of jewel exchange may occupy a literal space in courtly love poetry but a figurative position in mystic writing, the aspect of community is in many ways heightened within mystical writing and the exchange of hearts rendered in very literal terms.
Another aspect of courtly love is the unattainable beloved, generally the unattainable lady. For troubadours, and in courtly cycles like that of Lancelot and Guinevere, the unattainable beloved is typically a woman socially elevated above the pursuing lover-errant, or, worse yet, a married woman (often the queen). This could often be couched in language that was not offensive to the noble man married to the woman, and often invoked the exemplary virtue of the lady, who was often thought to be noble in class and honor. As courtly love poetry removed itself from the court (as in the Tuscan School and the subsequent dolce stil novo), the topos of the beloved queen began to be effaced from the literature, but the sense of the lady’s praiseworthiness was not diminished. The 13th-century poet, Guido Guinizzelli, exemplifies the virtuous nature of the beloved in his lyric poem, “Io voglio del ver la mia donna laudare,” in which the speaker explains that the all whom the lady greets loses their pride (“ch’abassa orgoglio a cui dona salute” (10)), and that no one can have bad thoughts when they behold her. The speaker, for his part, grows to be more virtuous, as well (12-14):
e no·lle pò apressare om che sia vile;
ancor ve dirò c’ha maggior vertute:
null’ om pò mal pensar fin che la vede.[7]
Similarly, in his lyric “Tanto gentile” from the Vita nova, Dante remarks on how the lady is dressed in humility (“benignamente d’umilità vestuta (6)), and how she seems to have been sent to Earth from Heaven: “e par che sia una cosa venuta / da cielo in terra a miracol mostrare” (7-8).[8] This construction — someone to love sent from Paradise to perform miracles within human society — is markedly similar to another who is beloved: Christ.
Thus, more than an Earthly queen, the true ultimate expression of the inaccessible beloved is one who is in Heaven, and both Dante and Petrarch employed this solution in their post-mortem figures of Beatrice and Laura respectively. While both ladies are considered to be within the kingdom of Paradise, and therefore within the general milieu of the court, for Dante in particular the figure of Beatrice, so virtuous and beatific, can be mapped onto the beloved of the mystic: Christ. The unattainable beloved is not only a woman of a higher class, but of nobler virtue, and the good lady serves to elevate her extolling lover to a higher plane. Christ, too, works this way for believers on earth, and the mystics address this aspect of Christ. In a Letter to Queen Elizabeth of Hungary, Catherine writes (T145):
Quale cuore si potrebbe tenere che non scoppiasse d’amore a ragguardare questo dolce e saporoso frutto, cioè il dolce e buono Gesù? il quale Dio Padre ha dato per sposo alla santa Chiesa. Dobbiamo dunque correre come innamorati, ed essere amatori della Chiesa santa per lo amore di Cristo crocifisso.[9] 
Upon seeing the bridegroom Christ, any Christian should be compelled to action, running to the Church, overwhelmed with goodness. As an unattainable (until death) beloved who also compels his lover to make himself or herself more virtuous, Christ is the ultimate object of courtly love devotion.
Guido Cavalcanti, whose work is among the least spiritually-inclined of the dolce stil novo poets, also notes how the virtue of his lady elevates the speaker-lover; she is like a divine goddess in his lyric poem of praise “Chi è questa che vèn, ch’ogn’om la mira” (9-14):
Non si poria contar la sua piagenza,
ch’a le’ s’inchin’ ogni gentil vertute,
e la beltate per sua dea la mostra.
Non fu sì alta già la mente nostra
e non si pose in noi tanta salute,
che propriamente n’aviam canoscenza.[10]
For Cavalcanti, the intellectual nobility may be higher than an orientation to the divine, but the same premise stands, as the beloved’s graciousness elevates the lover. Here Cavalcanti brings to bear another element that intersects with virtue: the ineffability that comes when the lover attempts to understand the lady’s goodness. The speaker cannot even fully describe her beauty (how pleasing she is), and when he tries to fathom her he explains that he is incapable of doing so within his own limitations. This inability to comprehend is echoed in the longer poem “Donna me prega,” which also considers the optics as discussed above. On this, Stewart writes, “...when he does speak of his perceptual appropriation of her, he emphasizes that his mind cannot fully grasp her image,” which suggests that it is not just the virtues of the lady that are ineffable, but her entire being and all that she represents (53). The inability lies not just in understanding the beloved, but in not understanding love and the virtues of love as an abstract concept.
This language is also consistent with religious language about God and self-knowledge, and Dante’s words as he progresses through Paradise, which begins in Canto I (“Nel ciel che più de la sua luce prende / fu’ io, e vidi cose che ridire / né sa né può chi di là sù discende”[11] (4-6)) and culminates in Canto XXXIII: “per tal modo / che ciò ch’i’ dico è un semplice lume,”[12] “credo ch’i’ vidi,”[13] “Omai sarà più corta mia favella, / pur a quel ch’io ricordo, che d’un fante / che bagni ancor la lingua a la mammella”[14] (89-90, 92, 106-108). Dante, as he travels through Heaven, believes that he forgets, can only speak of what he saw in rudimentary language, can only attest to what he believes he saw, and ultimately sees how incapable he is at describing what he has seen. Divine love, for poets and mystics alike, is outside of the capacity of human expression. As in Orazione 4 above, Catherine describes love as “ineffabile,” and God and Love can be considered to be one and the same. Throughout her Dialogo, she uses variants of the word “ineffabile” 30 times over its 167 chapters, pairing it with variants of “amore” or “amare” 80% of the time (in 24 instances). In chapter 96, Catherine writes of the limitation of speech in describing union with God:
Qual lingua potrebbe narrare l’eccellenza di questo ultimo stato unitivo, e i frutti diversi e svariati che in esso si ricevono, essendo riempite le tre potenza dell’anima? … E così via discorrendo, tutti ve l’hanno manifestata, chi per un modo e chi per un altro. Ma non potresti mai narrare l’intrinseco sentimento, l’ineffabile dolcezza e l’unione perfetta con me, con la tua lingua che è cosa finita.[15]
Catherine evokes the finiteness of the tongue’s capabilities at odds with the infinite quality of love and the divine. While she explains that doctors of the Church have revealed the glorious light through the Holy Scripture, this writing is also limited because love cannot be described until one experiences it. Although both Dante and Catherine suggest that the experience of divine love is not outside of human capacity, putting this experience into words seems beyond the human. This translates to the mystic or to other religious figure unable fully to understand the mechanisms of God’s love. The mystic is a participant of this infinite love, but not the originator of it, and she cannot render that aspect of love to others in human language. Despite being unable to produce divine love, the mystic remains a devoted servant to her lover just the same, steadfast and firm in her love.
This love is an overwhelming love; it overtakes the lover. In a letter to the Dominican Bartolomeo Dominici, Catherine suggests that this love, where the self is completely eradicated, is the ultimate expression of love: 
con desiderio di vedervi tanto annegato e affocato in Cristo Gesù, che al tutto vi perdiate voi medesimo. Ma questo non veggo che potiate avere se l'occhio dell'intelletto del vero desiderio non si leva sopra di voi a ragguardare l'occhio ineffabile della divina carità col quale Dio ragguardò (e ragguarda) la sua creatura, prima che ci creasse.[16] 
The negation of self, enflamed in his love, can only be achieved when the intellectual eye rises to look into the ineffable eye of divine charity. Again, we see the trope of the unexplainable, with the eye of divine charity that cannot be described. This all-encompassing love is similarly a common trope in courtly love poetry, as exemplified in 13-century poet Guido delle Colonne’s lyric “Amor, che lungiamente m’ai menato,” as he discusses being ridden by love against his will, citing Virgil’s “Amor che vince tutto” (24) among his arguments. Like Catherine’s depiction of the “pazzo d’amore” and feelings of drunkenness and madness while experiencing love, Guido also speaks to this loss of rational self (53-55):
Amor fa disviare li più sagi,
e chi più ama e pena à in sè misura;
più folle è quello che più si ‘nnamura.[17]
The idea of measure in courtly poetry expresses the Aristotelian idea of the mean, and how one should conduct oneself with constancy. However, as Guido writes in this poem, love unravels these systems to render the wise incapable of competing with the force of love. For Guido, this may be considered contrary to human order, but as Catherine continues in her letter, this is how one must approach God, who is also a mad lover, “La quale poiché ragguardò in sé medesimo, innamorossene smisuratamente; tanto che per amore ci creò, volendo che noi godessimo e participassimo quello bene che aveva in sé medesimo” (T204).[18] In courtly love this reciprocity between equal lovers is often not exemplified in this way for it operates outside the hierarchies of the human court, but as love poetry is blended with spirituality by Dante, he navigates “l'amor che move il sole e l'altre stelle.”
Working throughout the Commedia, Dante blends previous works into his more religiously-minded epic. Many have argued that these examples are palinode employed to distance his current work from earlier writing that was not as spiritually informed as his opus would prove to be. An example of this is in Canto II of Inferno, where Francesca and Paolo are damned for their amorous love that arose from reading about courtly love. Sara Sturm-Maddox also discusses the connection between the Rime petrose and Purgatorio, particularly with the figure of the Medusa, and how Dante must rid himself of this former life in order to pass into the Earthly Paradise.[19] However, Dante does not purge himself of courtly or erotic language altogether, and even uses the imagery of love’s teeth biting him in both his Rime petrose and in Canto XXVI of Paradiso:
Io mio penser di fuor sì che si scopra,
ch’io non fo de la morte, che ogni sense
co li denti d’Amor già mi manduca[20]


Ma dì ancor se tu senti altre corde
tirarti verso lui, sì che tu suone
con quanti denti questio amor ti morde[21]
Although this is not a direct citation, the image of love’s teeth biting him cannot be a coincidence, and the repetition of sense and thought in the surrounding context deepens that connection. Dante, then, does not see courtly and erotic love as outside of a divine context and, given that Dante is approved by the blessed in this Canto, he must not believe that there is an incongruity between amorous love and love for God. This incomplete departure suggests a rhetoric of courtly love consistent and compatible with a mystical discourse.
Arguing in her essay, “The Sexual Body in Dante’s Celestial Paradise,” that Dante co-opts courtly and erotic language throughout Paradiso, F. Regina Psaki emphasizes that in Paradise the soul is not actually without body, as after the Revelation souls will be joined with their bodies once again. Instead, she views erotic, embodied love as a site of redemption. Noting the innovative language of Dante, including neologism, she writes, “The colonization of the language of courtship, caress, intercourse, and orgasm as components of divine bliss would have struck a contemporary reader not because it was unprecedented, but precisely because it is not deployed in familiar fashion as simply a figure for the love which joins risen mankind and God” (57). Though I do not at all hope to diminish Dante’s ingenious and masterful use of language ripe with poetic force and meaning, I would like to suggest that his words that relate to corporeal and erotic romance, intercourse and orgasm were already a part of mystical writing, not just in the writing of the Beguine mystics, but also in Italian (Clare of Assisi and Angela of Foligno predate the writing of the Commedia), and that they would persist after his writing. We cannot be sure that Dante was reading mystical writing, bug it is unlikely that his contemporary reader would be as struck by the conflation of eroticism and redemption as a reader of the 21st century may well be, for spirituality for us seems loosened from the passionate love so embedded in late medieval writing. I would only like to suggest that the language of the mystic would have been circulating in the broader Italian culture and that the very erotic nature of texts that treat the divine, such as Dante’s courtly love epic, would likely be in dialogue with these texts. 
Petrarch, the other towering poet of the Italian 14th century, works in a more introspective manner than many of the poets that precede him. In describing Dante’s approach to poetry, Giuseppe Mazzotta argues that Dante is on a quest for “visionary poetry that would bind together various strands of experience against the partitions and fragmentations engendered by critical, analytical thinking,” whereas Petrarch views poetry “as the act by which fame is acquired and death is conquered” (12). Indeed, Petrarch’s conception of poetry can be perceived as a departure from the spiritually-minded work of his predecessor Dante, but ultimately they are both working with the idea of everlasting life. Petrarch, like his contemporary Catherine, travelled throughout Italy and to Provence, an itinerant poet. He wrote the poetry of his Rerum vulgarium fragmenta[22] over 40 years and continued to reorder the work, dealing more with fragments than the unified vision that Dante followed from his Vita nova through the Commedia. Though this poetry collection, famed for inspiring centuries of secular love poetry throughout Europe, may not popularly be read as a religious text, his 366 poems follow the 365 days of the liturgical calendar (with an introduction), he famously met Laura on Good Friday, and the last canzone is dedicated to the Virgin. A suffering lover like his courtly predecessors, Petrarch bears a cross for Laura, which leads to suffering and a form of redemption. Though he is turned into himself, this is consistent with Catherine’s own language of “self-knowledge” as a way to approach the divine.
The turn from Laura to the Virgin at the end of his Rime sparse turns the work into a chain of love that operates between God and humankind. The Virgin is now the object of his love as she stands in as a figure marked by an intimate love relationship with God. The poem becomes a prayer, rife with ritualized and formulaic language that also recalls Dante’s own prayer to the Virgin in Paradiso XXXIII. Speaking of Petrarch’s fascination with monastic spirituality, Mazzotta writes, “It can be said that Petrarch broadens the vast fields of theological reflection at the very moment when he confronts the figments of his vision and the demons of his own self. This is Petrarch’s radical project” (166). That is, Petrarch’s religious writing like De otio religioso do not do the same work that the Rime sparse does to truly expand religious experience in a way that does not relegate it to confined spaces. This mediation between the divine and the secular is evident in Petrarch’s poetic understanding of the Virgin (27-29):
Vergine pura, d’ogni parte intera,
del tuo parto gentil figliuola et madre,
ch’allumi questa vita, et l’atra adorni[23]
The Virgin as mediatrix, who illuminates this life, and adorns the other, working between the poet and the divine, and as a paradoxical woman who is both daughter and mother of her offspring (and later “madre, figliuola et sposa” (47)), serves as a figure that complicates the many fragments of Petrarch’s work and vision.
As exemplified in the figure of the Virgin, one of the more striking aspects of Petrarch’s poetry is his use of paradox and oxymoron, which is frequently employed in mystical writing. Catherine uses oxymoron in many instances to begin to describe her relation to God, or that which is ineffable. In her first Orazione, she sets up a series of binaries, showing how low of a creature she is compared to her creator:
Tu, deità, somma sapiencia, io ignorante e misera creatura, e tu somma ed etterna bontà; io morte e tu se' vita, io tenebre e tu luce, io stoltizia e tu sapiencia, tu infinito e io finita, io inferma e tu medico, io fragile peccatrice che non t'amai mai; tu bellezza purissima e io sozzissima creatura.[24]
The creature represents wretchedness, folly, death, darkness, ignorance and finiteness, while the creator represents all the opposite virtues. The opposing words occurring in close succession create a dizzying effect, and ultimately do not prove to be contradictory as the creature is made of the creator, so the divine (and conceivably the human) can occupy this paradoxical position. Similarly, Petrarch uses oxymoron and paradox throughout his Rime sparse, notably in his Sonnet 134 that treats death and life, hate and love, imprisonment and freedom: “Pace non trovo, et non ò da far guerra; / e temo, et spero; et ardo, et son un ghiaccio” (1-2).[25] The speaker-lover is unable to find peace despite being done with war, and fears and hopes and burns and freezes. Like Catherine, Petrarch juxtaposes contradicting words against each other, to describe his current, love-struck dizzying state. Catherine takes love and hatred in turn as well, as she depicts the soul, which must feed on other souls (that is, winning them to salvation) in her Dialogo: “Dico che ella mangia, prendendo in cibo le anime sulla mensa della santissima croce… Dico che lo schiaccia coi denti, altrimenti non lo potrebbe inghiottire; lo schiaccia con l’odio e con l’amore” (161).[26] Invoking oxymoronic language to describe a paradoxical situation (a soul eating other souls in order to save them) is poetically fitting and makes it possible for Catherine to render this difficult experience in language. For many 14th-century writers, both earthly and divine love exist as experiences outside of the full range of human language, and they rely on literary devices like paradox to attempt to convey these personal events to others.

Tusiani, p. 99). 
[2] “...oh mad lover! And you have need of your creature? It seems so to me, for you act as if you could not live without her, in spite of the fact that you are Life itself, and everything has life from you and nothing can have life without you. Why then are you so mad? Because you have fallen in love with what you have made! You are pleased and delighted over her within yourself, as if you were drunk [with desire] for her salvation. She runs away from you and you go looking for her. She strays and you draw closer to her. You clothed yourself in our humanity, and nearer than that you could not have come” (trans. Noffke).
[3] “Oh unutterable love, even though you saw all the evils that all your creatures would commit against your infinite goodness, you acted as if you did not see and set your eye only on the beauty of your creature, with whom you had fallen in love like one drunk and crazy with love. And in love you drew us out of yourself, giving us being in your own image and likeness. You, eternal Truth, have told me the truth: that love compelled you to create us. Even though you saw that we would offend you, your charity would not let you set your eyes on that sight. No, you took your eyes off the sin that was to be and fixed your gaze only on your creature’s beauty. For if you had concentrated on the sin, you would have forgotten the love you had for creating humankind. Not that the sin was hid from you, but you concentrated on the love because you are nothing but a fire of love, crazy over what you have made” (trans. Noffke as Prayer 13, 18 February 1379).
[4] This mystical expression of the experience of love is long-resonating, as being drunk and crazy in love are still very much a part of western culture’s love rhetoric, as exemplified in Beyoncé’s “Crazy in Love” (2003) and “Drunk in Love” (2013).
