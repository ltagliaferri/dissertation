Their work established the canon of Italian literature, while having also been among the first ventures and earliest innovations of vernacular writing. Though she is also writing as one of the founders of the Italian literary tradition, Catherine is more often relegated to religious or political rather than literary status (as discussed above). However, she uses language, themes and constructions markedly similar to those of Petrarch and Dante. While each of these texts participates in different communities, appeal to different audiences, and serve various and diverse purposes, the primary vernacular texts of each author &mdash; Dante&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c1">Commedia</span><span class="c0">, Petrarch&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c1">Rime sparse</span><span class="c0">, and Catherine&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c1">Dialogo </span><span class="c3 c0">&mdash; show overlaps of diction, topic, and word frequency. This suggests that the work being done by each of these authors is operating within a particular context, and that there is a certain amount of exchange between these different forms and styles of writing (i.e. mystical and lyrical writing), which is not merely one-directional.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Franco Moretti, in theorizing world literature and arguing against canon-based close reading, makes a case for &ldquo;distant reading:&rdquo; &ldquo;where distance ... </span><span class="c0 c1">is a condition of knowledge</span><span class="c0">: it allows you to focus on units that are much smaller or much larger than the text: devices, themes, tropes &mdash; or genres and systems&rdquo; (49). If we are to recover missing voices from the canon, who have been overlooked due to their marginalized status (be that due to gender, race, religion, economic status, etc.), it becomes imperative to employ new methods of entering into analytical and theoretical discourse. Utilizing a quantitative approach enabled through digital humanities statistical computation can allow readers to look at Catherine&rsquo;s texts in light of her fellow Italian vernacular innovators that </span><span class="c0 c1">are</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;within the literary canon. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">When applying a digital humanities computational-driven methodology to explore texts, especially those written prior to moveable type that exist in various iterations across manuscript editions, one must bear in mind statistician George E. P. Box&rsquo;s warning: &ldquo;Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0">424</span><span class="c3 c0">). Applying modes of reading texts &mdash; in the humanities writ large or statistical models via digital humanities techniques &mdash; is subject to careful analysis, and each method is merely another way of &ldquo;getting at&rdquo; a text; not a definitive answer. This is why Moretti&rsquo;s proposal for &ldquo;distant reading&rdquo; can prove useful, as using machines to read texts can provide this wider perspective as a counter-balance to close reading. My inquiry into Catherine&rsquo;s writing brings together computer-based textual analysis and traditional humanistic examination to arrive at a more robust account of her writing and its context. My digital humanities approach uses both statistical word counts and topic models based on a machine learning algorithm trained on a corpus of available 14th-century Italian texts, all of which are visualized so as to be readily accessible. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">It is worth noting that the </span><span class="c0 c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;represents the largest corpus by far with 143,906 words, with the </span><span class="c0 c1">Commedia</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c0 c1">Rime sparse</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;containing 101,602 and 57,154 words respectively. Among these three texts, there are 21,549 unique words out of 302,662 words total, that is 7% of the words are unique. The 7% figure shows the vocabulary density of all of these texts, which refers to the measurement of vocabulary usage in comparison to the length of the text, computed by dividing the total words of a text by the total unique words. Of these three corpora, the text with the most vocabulary density is the </span><span class="c0 c1">Commedia</span><span class="c0">, with the </span><span class="c0 c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;being the least dense. Dante and Petrarch are much more likely to use variations on the same word in order to fit rhyme schemes and syllabic constraints, and it is up to the analyzer to choose whether or not to render &ldquo;amore&rdquo; and &ldquo;amor&rdquo; as the same word. In most cases, I chose to have words count differently unless I specify otherwise. These variations of the same word, however, are likely a major computational component of the vocabulary density of their texts. Certain words trend throughout the three texts, with notable peaks in frequency occurring across the corpora: &ldquo;vero&rdquo; (peak at the end), &ldquo;anime&rdquo; (peak at the end), &ldquo;cielo&rdquo; (peak in the middle), &ldquo;etterna&rdquo; (peak at the end), &ldquo;misericordia&rdquo; (peak at the end). The three texts analyzed together reveal a frequent use of commonly used words throughout them, including &ldquo;amore,&rdquo; &ldquo;lume,&rdquo; &ldquo;desiderio,&rdquo; &ldquo;dolce,&rdquo; &ldquo;occhio/occhi.&rdquo; When considering Catherine&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;alone, along with the words above, &ldquo;anima&rdquo; and &ldquo;virt&ugrave;&rdquo; are more frequent. The </span><span class="c0 c1">Rime sparse</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;favors words like &ldquo;bel,&rdquo; &ldquo;ben,&rdquo; &ldquo;cor&rdquo; (not combined with &ldquo;cuore&rdquo;), &ldquo;donna,&rdquo; &ldquo;morte&rdquo; and &ldquo;sol.&rdquo; The </span><span class="c0 c1">Commedia</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;utilizes words like &ldquo;ben,&rdquo; &ldquo;disse,&rdquo; &ldquo;fuor&rdquo; and &ldquo;terra&rdquo; more frequently. As</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Dante&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c1">Paradiso</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;engages with other-worldly concerns in ways </span><span class="c0">similar to mystical writing</span><span class="c0">, I performed a separate analysis on this canticle (here I changed all instances of &ldquo;amore&rdquo; to &ldquo;amor&rdquo;), and when compared with the </span><span class="c0 c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c3 c0">, we can see that many words are frequently used across both texts, with &ldquo;amor&rdquo;/&rdquo;amore&rdquo; and &ldquo;lume&rdquo; among the most frequently used words, and other words and categories of words related to Christ, the mind and consciousness, corporeality and nature, and eyesight all being shared across the two texts.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">To further see the categories of words and themes that these texts are dealing with, topic modeling analysis was performed across all of the texts mentioned above as well as Catherine&rsquo;s collection of letters. I used stop word lists of very common words like &ldquo;un&rdquo; and &ldquo;il&rdquo; so that these would not be counted in the final analysis and throw off the results of meaningful words. For word frequency analysis, the </span><span class="c0">stop word</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;lists included personal pronouns, but I reinstated them for topic modeling as they would no longer overwhelm the sample sizes. Topic modeling is a means computationally to detect the close proximity of words that renders frequent clusters of words called topics, and the full topic modeling analysis of these texts is in the </span><span class="c0">Appendix</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c0">.

There are some differences between the two sets &mdash; &ldquo;luce,&rdquo; though similar to &ldquo;lume&rdquo; does not occur in the </span><span class="c0 c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;topic model, and though &ldquo;lume&rdquo; is also concerned with vision, Dante employs &ldquo;veder,&rdquo; &ldquo;vidi,&rdquo; &ldquo;occhi&rdquo; while Catherine does not. There is an interest in the body with Catherine, though not the eyes in particular &mdash; preferring the words &ldquo;corpo,&rdquo; &ldquo;sangue&rdquo; and related words like &ldquo;pena,&rdquo; &ldquo;affecto,&rdquo; morte.&rdquo; Instead of seeing, Catherine is more concerned with speech (&ldquo;decto&rdquo;). The word &ldquo;dio&rdquo; that both Dante and Catherine use, is joined by &ldquo;figliuolo&rdquo; in Catherine&rsquo;s topic model. Additionally, Dante is concerned with the physical space of Paradise, using the words for sky and sun near each other, and he is also concerned with nature and the figure of the woman and Beatrice in particular. Catherine&rsquo;s proximate words instead show a dualism between the body on one side and the soul on the other, she speaks of desire and virtue and truth while Dante evokes the mind with &ldquo;mente.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">This data suggests that the tradition related to lyrical poetry</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;and mystical writing may well inform each other, and that Catherine&rsquo;s writing, far from being unlearned, is actively engaging with the larger linguistic world of her time. </span></p><p class="c11 c18"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Like mystics who have proven to be master practitioners of shifting subjectivities, the writers of courtly love poetry also negotiate their relative subjectivity and objectivity in relation to their lover. Using amorous and erotic language to do so, they simultaneously contemplate virtue and the loss of self, just as mystic writers do. Though theorists like Beauvoir have argued that mystics, inherently feminine, have been informed by their experience of love and love poetry because they have not been able to function within another domain, </span><span class="c0">here I would like to suggest that there is an exchange&mdash;not a one-directional influence&mdash;between mystic writing and love poetry. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><span class="c0">Love poetry generally borrows language from religious writing (the loved lady as the Sun, for example), but is typically thought to eroticize the religious language; and some have argued that the Song of Songs is the solitary gateway for religious and erotic language to mingle together. But mystical writing, while also informed by the Song of Songs,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has had a long-standing tradition of erotically-charged language used as a means to access knowledge in general and sacred knowledge in particular</span><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">. The tradition of love poetry that comes out of courtly love, and of which I will consider Catherine&rsquo;s fellow Italian vernacular writers, similarly uses erotic language as an avenue to knowledge of love, knowledge of metaphysics (as with Guido Cavalcanti), and knowledge of God.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">In the chapter &ldquo;Vernacular Voices of the </span><span class="c0 c1">Donna</span><span class="c0">: Pisa&rdquo; in </span><span class="c0 c1">Reclaiming Catherine of Siena</span><span class="c0">, Jane Tylus writes of the significance of the Italian preference for the courtly word </span><span class="c0 c1">donna</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;rather than the more biological </span><span class="c0 c1">femmina</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for &ldquo;woman,&rdquo; which persists to this day. More than biological, the Italian word </span><span class="c0 c1">femmina</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;reveals a somewhat negative connotation, as the 1612 edition of the </span><span class="c0 c1">Vocabolario della Crusca</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;defines the word as &ldquo;Quell&rsquo; animale cos&igrave; ragionevole, come bruto, che concorre col maschio, come recipiente, sesso. </span><span class="c0 c1">L. foeminas</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Castiglione, in his 1528 work </span><span class="c0 c1">Il libro del Cortegiano</span><span class="c0">, uses the word &ldquo;femine&rdquo; as a corrollary to &ldquo;maschi,&rdquo; when discussing childbirth and biology, but employs the word &ldquo;donna&rdquo; much more when discussing the court lady in Book III. </span><span class="c0">Catherine herself makes the distinction between the two words: </span><span class="c0 c1">femmina</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as weak, </span><span class="c0 c1">donna</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as cultivating strength and will. </span><span class="c0 c1">Donna</span><span class="c0">, derived from the Latin word </span><span class="c0 c1">domina</span><span class="c0">, is the feminine noun counterpart to </span><span class="c0 c1">Dominus</span><span class="c0">, a word for God. In literal terms, </span><span class="c0 c1">dominus</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is lord and </span><span class="c0 c1">donna</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is lady, with all the undertones of King Arthur&rsquo;s court. As Tylus argues, the word </span><span class="c0 c1">lady</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is not typically employed more than </span><span class="c0 c1">woman</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in other languages, for example, the French preferring </span><span class="c0 c1">femme</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;over </span><span class="c0 c1">dame</span><span class="c0">. Though it is interesting that this distinction has been so compelling and influential to the Italian language over time, the use of </span><span class="c0 c1">donna</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;in courtly love poetry reveals the play with subjectivity inherent in these texts. By instilling so much force in the word used for the beloved, granting her a domain and a queendom regardless of her social status&mdash;even perhaps suggestive of a feminine god&mdash;the masculine lover-speaker mitigates his own power in linguistic terms, often of course significant to the meaning of the poetry.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">In terms of feminist analysis, there is a lot to unpack out of troubadour poetry and the subsequent courtly love poetry that developed in the Italian language first in the Sicilian court of Frederick II (the Sicilian School), then through to the Tuscan School and Dante&rsquo;s own cohort of the </span><span class="c0 c1">dolce stil novo</span><span class="c0">. Though it can be argued that the elevated position of the female beloved in relation to the male pursuer can be seen as progressive, even patronizing, it is also possible to read the texts not as a binary representation of a masculine knight-errant pursuing an inaccessible feminine lover, but as a negotiation of several power hierarchies in an amorous relationship. For each poet, these dynamics play out differently, and in poetry cycles much can be shifted. While Beatrice is known to be the virtuous and lofty unattainable woman in Dante&rsquo;s love poetry, Dante also presents a very different woman and very different speaker-lover in his </span><span class="c0 c1">Rime petrose</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cycle, &ldquo;La crudele.&rdquo; Here the stone woman may be the more powerful one in the relationship, as Dante also does depict Beatrice, but the Donna Pietra is not virtuous and seems to be the aggressor who overtakes the fleeing speaker-lover. In the last of the four poems, &ldquo;Cos&igrave; nel mio parlar voglio esser aspro,&rdquo; rape imagery and the notion of eros as revenge are intersected with imagery of the liturgical hours (66-73): </span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">S&rsquo;io avessi le belle trecce prese,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">che fatte son per me scudiscio e ferza,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">pigliandole anzi terza,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">con essere passerei vespero e squille:</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">e non sarei pietoso n&eacute; cortese,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">anzi farei com&rsquo;orso quando scerza;</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">e se Amor me ne sferza,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">io mi vendicherei di pi&ugrave; di mille. </span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The imagery of the bear is from an old proverb: if you don&#39;t want to get bitten, don&rsquo;t play with a bear. Here the speaker-lover expects a violent sex act on the part of both parties. The church bells show the passage of night, but they also lend a sacred sense to the representation, especially considering that Dante brings imagery from this poem into </span><span class="c0 c1">Paradiso</span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;XXVI (discussed below).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The conflation of erotic and spiritual imagery that we see in Dante&rsquo;s poem above has existed intrinsically within mystical writing from its origins, and there are many surprising overlaps between mystic and courtly writing. </span><span class="c0">Barbara Newman describes 13th-century Beguine writing as &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c1">la mystique courtoise</span><span class="c0">,</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">arguing that writers such as </span><span class="c0">Hadewijch, Mechthild, and Marguerite Porete experiment with polyvalent subjectivity, sometimes as the beloved bride of Christ the bridegroom and sometimes as the knight-errant longing for his/her faraway beloved. Hadewijch, for example, twins &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;she&rdquo; in her lyric poetry</span><span class="c0">, &ldquo;indistinguishable from the troubadour&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and even pretends to abandon love and spurn her beloved, which &ldquo;only initiates will recognize &hellip; as God&rdquo; (148). Beguine mysticism adopted both the monastic allegorical tradition surrounding the Song of Songs as well as a courtly love tradition: &ldquo;In combination, the two discourses may reinforce each other or they may work at cross-purposes, almost incidentally conferring dual gender on both the lover and the divine Beloved&rdquo; (138). I would add that it is not just the mystics who are combining the two threads of Song of Songs subjectivity-shifting monasticism and courtly love, for how else can Dante bring </span><span class="c0">erotic and spiritual language together into his courtly love poetry, but also ultimately into </span><span class="c0 c1">Paradiso</span><span class="c3 c0">?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Even in the writing of the poet considered the most secular of the </span><span class="c0 c1">dolce stil novo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;group, Guido Cavalcanti, </span><span class="c0 c1">donna</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(again, related to </span><span class="c0 c1">dominus</span><span class="c0">) is employed throughout his poetry (the famous &ldquo;Donna me prega&rdquo; is considered here in particular), displacing power from the masculine speaker to the feminine beloved. Unlike the beloved of some of his contemporary poets, Cavalcanti&rsquo;s beloved is not depicted as cruel, stingy with her love, nor is she in any way punished for her power over him; instead he is a willing servant to her and happy to suffer for his love. This resembles the mystic&rsquo;s relation to God, as the mystic is always full of love and ready to serve her lord. As Dana Stewart explains, for Cavalcanti the </span><span class="c0 c1">donna</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is equipped with the Platonic model of active eyes, while the speaker has the Aristotelian model of passive eyes (49). The words for eyes (</span><span class="c0 c1">occhi</span><span class="c0">) and other vision-based words including light (</span><span class="c0 c1">lume</span><span class="c3 c0">), are used throughout love poetry and mystical writing; Cavalcanti, who writes in a very philosophical manner, uses these terms as they relate to the science of optics, as he was aware of it in his time. In discussing Cavalcanti within the theoretical cinematic model of the male gaze, Stewart writes, &ldquo;The poet-lover exerts no controlling gaze over her [his beloved],&rdquo; revealing his relative subordination to the beloved (54). Intellectually, as will be discussed below, Cavalcanti is unable to grasp the image of his beloved, which further demonstrates his lack of power in relation to the woman who exists in an ineffable state.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">In both mystical and courtly love writing, shifting subjectivities are constantly in flux, as they are in Catherine&rsquo;s writing. While Beguine mystics may often operate within a traditional role reversal with Christ as love object, Dante and other Italian poets depict throughout their texts a negotiation between the one who is the beloved and the lover. Catherine transposes relations so that she instead is the one that God is after, as can be seen in the </span><span class="c0 c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as well as her </span><span class="c0 c1">Orazioni</span><span class="c3 c0">: </span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">...o pazzo d&rsquo;amore!

She talks about love as ineffable, a metaphor for self knowledge, and also of his beloved straying from the pursuing love, an allegory of the sinning human escaping God. She discusses God becoming man in Christ, and how that resolves some of the lovers&rsquo; tension, though man will always be expected to sin. The prayer in particular speaks to God&rsquo;s not giving up on his creation&mdash;the errant knight who continuously pursues his beloved.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c0">Love poetry is often thought of as an exchange between two individuals, or even just the solitary writing of one party to another disinterested one (as the act of writing itself is often conflated with working alone). However courtly love poetry is inherently part of a larger community: the court. As Newman explains, the amorous couple is never truly alone and is always enveloped by friends, foes, or jealous members of the court. She writes (142),</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">A fulfilled relationship could overcome the solipsism of immature lovers and blossom into what Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes called the Joy of the Court. In his </span><span class="c0 c1">Erec et &Eacute;nide</span><span class="c3 c0">, high festival is held when mature lovers also achieve the integration of private desire with social responsibility. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c0">That is, there is an assimilation of the private to the public within courtly love, which is also a topos for the mystic; this Newman demonstrates in her discussion of the Beguine mystic in particular. The mystic is surrounded by spiritual friends and is often in the position of sharing her bridegroom of Christ with them. In states of ecstasy, the mystic is often with others, dictating her experience to scribes, thus making a very private and erotic affair an aspect of the wider spiritual community of which she is part. While some cloistered or otherwise reclusive mystics, like Hildegard, are members of a much smaller community (though certainly still a community nonetheless), mystics like Catherine who are engaged with society invariably have social responsibility as a larger aspect of their mysticism and love with Christ. Therefore, in a figure like Catherine, the topos of community within courtly love is particularly strong, and she must not consider just herself and her lover alone but all the societal implications as an aspect of her mystical experiences and writing.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">A typical component of courtly love is the giving of gifts and their joyful reception by the lady. Though generally the gifts that Christ and God bestow upon the mystics are the virtues (charity, chastity), or tribulations such as poverty and illness,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Catherine (and a few other women who experienced mystical marriages with Christ) states that she like all Christians receive a foreskin ring from Christ.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;She considers this to be more precious than a jewel, but the gift exchange is in keeping with courtly love motifs and plotlines. Further, the </span><span class="c0">exchange of hearts</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;between lovers is the utmost expression of passion in courtly love poetry. Dante mentions that the allegorical figure of Love holds his heart within his hands in the first poem of </span><span class="c0 c1">La vita nuova</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;in Chapter III (9-11): </span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">Allegro mi sembrava Amor tenendo</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">meo core in mano, e ne le braccia avea</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">madonna involta in un drappo dormendo.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">More cruelly, Boccaccio&rsquo;s Tancredi serves the heart of Ghismonda&rsquo;s lover in a golden chalice for her to eat in the first story of the fourth day of the </span><span class="c0 c1">Decameron</span><span class="c0">. In non-mystical literature, the exchange and displacement of the heart</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is usually expressed in metaphorical terms (when all parties are alive anyway), with one of the two individuals expressing to the other that they have full control over the other&rsquo;s heart, in mysticism this exchange of hearts can be quite literal. According to Raymond, Catherine herself exchanged hearts with Christ, with her heart beating inside his body and Christ&rsquo;s heart contained within her body for three days. Heather Webb notes that this exchange is not depicted within Catherine&rsquo;s own writing,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;but another example of literal heart exchange is also present in the mystic writing of Lutgardis in the early 13th century. Though the motif of jewel exchange may occupy a literal space in courtly love poetry but a figurative position in mystic writing, the aspect of community is in many ways heightened within mystical writing and the exchange of hearts rendered in very literal terms.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Another aspect of courtly love is the unattainable beloved, generally the unattainable lady. For troubadours, and in courtly cycles like that of Lancelot and Guinevere, the unattainable beloved is typically a woman socially elevated above the pursuing lover-errant, or, worse yet, a married woman (often the queen). This could often be couched in language that was not offensive to the noble man married to the woman, and often invoked the exemplary virtue of the lady, who was generally thought to be noble in class and honor. As courtly love poetry removed itself from the court (as in the Tuscan School and the subsequent </span><span class="c0 c1">dolce stil novo</span><span class="c0">), the topos of the beloved queen began to be effaced from the literature, but the sense of the lady&rsquo;s praiseworthiness was not diminished. The 13th-century poet, Guido Guinizzelli, exemplifies the virtuous nature of the beloved in his lyric poem, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Io voglio del ver la mia donna laudare</span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">,&rdquo; in which the speaker explains that all whom the lady greets lose their pride (&ldquo;ch&rsquo;abassa orgoglio a cui dona salute&rdquo; (10)), and that no one can have bad thoughts when they behold her. The speaker, for his part, grows to be more virtuous, as well (12-14):</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3 c0">e no&middot;lle p&ograve; apressare om che sia vile;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c3 c0">ancor ve dir&ograve; c&rsquo;ha maggior vertute:</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">null&rsquo; om p&ograve; mal pensar fin che la vede.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Similarly, in his </span><span class="c0 c1">canzone</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Donne ch&rsquo;avete intelletto d&#39;amore,&rdquo; in chapter XIX of the </span><span class="c0 c1">Vita nova</span><span class="c3 c0">, Dante writes of a woman who perishes any man who is with sin, while any man who can look at her has sin erased from him by God (32-42):</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">...che quando va per via,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">gitta nei cor villani Amore un gelo,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">per che onne lor pensero agghiaccia e pere;</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">e qual soffrisse di starla a vedere</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">diverria nobil cosa, o si morria.</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">E quando trova alcun che degno sia</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">di veder lei, quei prova sua vertute,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">ch&eacute; li avvien, ci&ograve; che li dona, in salute,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">e s&igrave; l&#39;umilia, ch&#39;ogni offesa oblia.</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">Ancor l&#39;ha Dio per maggior grazia dato</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">che non p&ograve; mal finir chi l&#39;ha parlato.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11 c18"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c11 c18"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">These two women are acting as servants of God, eradicating sin in their wake, or else further elevating those who are able to look at them. Additionally, the sonnet &ldquo;Tanto gentile e tanto onesta pare&rdquo; from the XXVI chapter of </span><span class="c0 c1">Vita nova</span><span class="c0">, Dante remarks on how the lady is dressed in humility (&ldquo;benignamente d&rsquo;umilit&agrave; vestuta&rdquo; (6)), and how she seems to have been sent to Earth from Heaven: &ldquo;e par che sia una cosa venuta / da cielo in terra a miracol mostrare&rdquo; (7-8).</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;This construction &mdash; someone to love sent from Paradise to perform miracles within human society &mdash; is markedly similar to another who is beloved: Christ. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Thus, more than an Earthly queen, the true ultimate expression of the inaccessible beloved is one who is in Heaven, and both Dante and Petrarch eventually employed this solution in their post-mortem figures of Beatrice and Laura respectively. While both ladies are considered to be within the kingdom of Paradise, and therefore within the general milieu of the court, for Dante in particular the figure of Beatrice, so virtuous and beatific, </span><span class="c0">can be mapped onto the beloved of the mystic: Christ</span><span class="c0">. First appearing within the </span><span class="c0 c1">Commedia</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the the XXX canto of the earthly canticle of </span><span class="c0 c1">Purgatorio</span><span class="c0">, Beatrice would go on to literally and figuratively bring Dante up and into Paradise. </span><span class="c3 c0">The unattainable beloved is not only a woman of a higher class, but of nobler virtue, and the good lady serves to elevate her lover to a higher plane. Christ, too, works this way for believers on earth, and the mystics address this aspect of Christ. In a Letter to Queen Elizabeth of Hungary, Catherine writes (T145):</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">Quale cuore si potrebbe tenere che non scoppiasse d&rsquo;amore a ragguardare questo dolce e saporoso frutto, cio&egrave; il dolce e buono Ges&ugrave;? il quale Dio Padre ha dato per sposo alla santa Chiesa. Dobbiamo dunque correre come innamorati, ed essere amatori della Chiesa santa per lo amore di Cristo crocifisso.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Upon seeing the bridegroom Christ, any Christian should be compelled to action, running to the Church, overwhelmed with goodness. As an unattainable (until death) beloved who also compels his lover to make himself or herself more virtuous, </span><span class="c0">Christ is the ultimate object of courtly love devotion</span><sup><a href="#cmnt10" id="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Guido Cavalcanti, whose work is among the least spiritually-inclined of the </span><span class="c0 c1">dolce stil novo </span><span class="c3 c0">poets, also notes how the virtue of his lady elevates the speaker-lover; she is like a divine goddess in his lyric poem of praise &ldquo;Chi &egrave; questa che v&egrave;n, ch&rsquo;ogn&rsquo;om la mira&rdquo; (9-14):</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">Non si poria contar la sua piagenza,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">ch&rsquo;a le&rsquo; s&rsquo;inchin&rsquo; ogni gentil vertute,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">e la beltate per sua dea la mostra.</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">Non fu s&igrave; alta gi&agrave; la mente nostra</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">e non si pose in noi tanta salute,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">che propriamente n&rsquo;aviam canoscenza.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c0">For Cavalcanti, intellectual nobility may be higher than an orientation to the divine, but the same premise stands, as the beloved&rsquo;s graciousness elevates the lover. Here Cavalcanti brings to bear another element that intersects with virtue: the ineffability that comes when the lover attempts to understand the lady&rsquo;s goodness. The speaker cannot even fully describe her beauty (how pleasing she is), and when he tries to fathom her he explains that he is incapable of doing so within his own limitations. This inability to comprehend is echoed in the longer poem &ldquo;Donna me prega,&rdquo; which also considers the optics as discussed above. On this, Stewart writes, &ldquo;when he does speak of his perceptual appropriation of her, he emphasizes that his mind cannot fully grasp her image,&rdquo; which suggests that it is not just the virtues of the lady that are ineffable, but her entire being and all that she represents (53). The inability lies not just in understanding the beloved, but in not understanding love and the virtues of love as an abstract concept.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">This language is also consistent with religious language about God and self-knowledge, and Dante&rsquo;s words as he progresses through Paradise, which begins in Canto I (&ldquo;Nel ciel che pi&ugrave; de la sua luce prende / fu&rsquo; io, e vidi cose che ridire / n&eacute; sa n&eacute; pu&ograve; chi di l&agrave; s&ugrave; discende&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;(4-6)) and culminates in Canto XXXIII: &ldquo;per tal modo / che ci&ograve; ch&rsquo;i&rsquo; dico &egrave; un semplice lume,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;credo ch&rsquo;i&rsquo; vidi,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Omai sar&agrave; pi&ugrave; corta mia favella, / pur a quel ch&rsquo;io ricordo, che d&rsquo;un fante / che bagni ancor la lingua a la mammella&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;(89-90, 92, 106-108). Dante, as he travels through Heaven, believes that he forgets, can only speak of what he saw in rudimentary language, can only attest to what he believes he saw, and ultimately sees how incapable he is at describing what he has seen. Divine love, for poets and mystics alike, is outside of the capacity of human expression. As in </span><span class="c0 c1">Orazione</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;4 above, Catherine describes love as &ldquo;ineffabile,&rdquo; and God and Love can be considered to be one and the same. Throughout her </span><span class="c0 c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">, she uses variants of the word &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">ineffabile</span><sup><a href="#cmnt11" id="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&rdquo; 30 times over its 167 chapters, pairing it with variants of &ldquo;amore&rdquo; or &ldquo;amare&rdquo; 80% of the time (in 24 instances). In chapter 96, Catherine writes of the limitation of speech in describing union with God:</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">Qual lingua potrebbe narrare l&rsquo;eccellenza di questo ultimo stato unitivo, e i frutti diversi e svariati che in esso si ricevono, essendo riempite le tre potenza dell&rsquo;anima? &hellip; E cos&igrave; via discorrendo, tutti ve l&rsquo;hanno manifestata, chi per un modo e chi per un altro. Ma non potresti mai narrare l&rsquo;intrinseco sentimento, l&rsquo;ineffabile dolcezza e l&rsquo;unione perfetta con me, con la tua lingua che &egrave; cosa finita.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c0">Catherine evokes the finiteness of the tongue&rsquo;s capabilities at odds with the infinite quality of love and the divine. While she explains that doctors of the Church have revealed the glorious light through the Holy Scripture, this writing is also limited because love cannot be described until one experiences it. Although both Dante and Catherine suggest that the experience of divine love is not outside of human capacity, putting this experience into words seems beyond what the human is capable of. This translates to the mystic or other religious figure unable to fully understand the mechanisms of God&rsquo;s love. The mystic is a participant of this infinite love, but not the originator of it, and she cannot render that aspect of love to others in human language. Despite being unable to produce divine love, the mystic remains a devoted servant to her lover just the same, steadfast and firm in her love.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c3 c0">This love is an overwhelming love; it overtakes the lover. In a letter to the Dominican Bartolomeo Dominici, Catherine suggests that this love, where the self is completely eradicated, is the ultimate expression of love: </span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">con desiderio di vedervi tanto annegato e affocato in Cristo Ges&ugrave;, che al tutto vi perdiate voi medesimo. Ma questo non veggo che potiate avere se l&#39;occhio dell&#39;intelletto del vero desiderio non si leva sopra di voi a ragguardare l&#39;occhio ineffabile della divina carit&agrave; col quale Dio ragguard&ograve; (e ragguarda) la sua creatura, prima che ci creasse.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3 c0">The negation of self, enflamed in this love, can only be achieved when the intellectual eye rises to look into the ineffable eye of divine charity. Again, we see the trope of the unexplainable, with the eye of divine charity that cannot be described. This all-encompassing love is similarly a common trope in courtly love poetry, as exemplified in 13th-century poet Guido delle Colonne&rsquo;s lyric &ldquo;Amor, che lungiamente m&rsquo;ai menato,&rdquo; as he discusses being ridden by love against his will, citing Virgil&rsquo;s &ldquo;Amor che vince tutto&rdquo; (24) among his arguments. Like Catherine&rsquo;s depiction of the &ldquo;pazzo d&rsquo;amore&rdquo; and feelings of drunkenness and madness while experiencing love, Guido also speaks to this loss of rational self (53-55):</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">Amor fa disviare li pi&ugrave; sagi,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">e chi pi&ugrave; ama e pena &agrave; in s&egrave; misura;</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">pi&ugrave; folle &egrave; quello che pi&ugrave; si &lsquo;nnamura.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The idea of measure in courtly poetry expresses the Aristotelian idea of the mean, and how one should conduct oneself with constancy. However, as Guido writes in this poem, love unravels these systems to render the wise incapable of competing with the force of love. For Guido, this may be considered contrary to human order, but as Catherine continues in her letter, this is how one must approach God, who is also a mad lover, &ldquo;La quale poich&eacute; ragguard&ograve; in s&eacute; medesimo, innamorossene smisuratamente; tanto che per amore ci cre&ograve;, volendo che noi godessimo e participassimo quello bene che aveva in s&eacute; medesimo&rdquo; (T204).</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;In courtly love this reciprocity between equal lovers is often not exemplified in this way for it operates outside the hierarchies of the human court, but as love poetry is blended with spirituality by Dante, he navigates &ldquo;l&rsquo;amor che move il sole e l&rsquo;altre stelle&rdquo; (XXXIII, 142-145).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Working throughout the </span><span class="c0 c1">Commedia</span><span class="c0">, Dante blends previous works into his more religiously-minded epic. Many have argued that these examples are palinodes employed to distance his current work from earlier writing that was not as spiritually informed as his opus would prove to be. An example of this is in Canto V of </span><span class="c0 c1">Inferno</span><span class="c0">, where Francesca and Paolo are damned for their amorous love that arose from reading about courtly love. Sara Sturm-Maddox also discusses the connection between the </span><span class="c0 c1">Rime petrose</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c1">Purgatorio</span><span class="c0">, particularly with the figure of the Medusa, and how Dante must rid himself of this former life in order to pass into the Earthly Paradise.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;However, Dante does not purge himself of courtly or erotic language altogether, and even uses the imagery of love&rsquo;s teeth biting him in both his </span><span class="c0 c1">Rime petrose</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and in Canto XXVI of </span><span class="c0 c1">Paradiso</span><span class="c3 c0">:</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">Io</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;mio penser di fuor s&igrave; che si scopra,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">ch&rsquo;io non fo de la morte, che ogni sense</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">co li denti d&rsquo;Amor gi&agrave; mi manduca</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup></p><p class="c11 c13 c18"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">Ma d&igrave; ancor se tu senti altre corde</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0 c3">tirarti verso lui, s&igrave; che tu suone</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">con quanti denti questio amor ti morde</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Although this is not a direct citation, the image of love&rsquo;s teeth biting him cannot be a coincidence, and the repetition of sense and thought in the surrounding context deepens that connection. </span><span class="c0">Dante, then, does not see courtly and erotic love as outside of a divine context and, given that Dante is approved by the blessed in this Canto, he must not believe that there is an incongruity between amorous love and love for God. This incomplete departure suggests a rhetoric of courtly love consistent and compatible with a mystical discourse.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt12" id="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Arguing in her essay, &ldquo;The Sexual Body in Dante&rsquo;s Celestial Paradise,&rdquo; that Dante co-opts courtly and erotic language throughout </span><span class="c0 c1">Paradiso</span><span class="c0">, F. Regina Psaki emphasizes that in Paradise the soul is not actually without body, as after the Last Judgement souls will be joined with their bodies once again. Instead, she views erotic, embodied love as a site of redemption. Noting the innovative language of Dante, including neologism, she writes, &ldquo;The colonization of the language of courtship, caress, intercourse, and orgasm as components of divine bliss would have struck a contemporary reader not because it was unprecedented, but precisely because it is not deployed in familiar fashion as simply a figure for the love which joins risen mankind and God&rdquo; (57). Though it is clear that Dante&rsquo;s ingenious and masterful use of language ripe with poetic force and meaning, I would like to suggest that his words that relate to corporeal and erotic romance, intercourse and orgasm were already a part of mystical writing, not just in the writing of the Beguine mystics, but also in Italy (Clare of Assisi and Angela of Foligno </span><span class="c0">predate</span><sup><a href="#cmnt13" id="cmnt_ref13">[m]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt14" id="cmnt_ref14">[n]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt15" id="cmnt_ref15">[o]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt16" id="cmnt_ref16">[p]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt17" id="cmnt_ref17">[q]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt18" id="cmnt_ref18">[r]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;the writing of the </span><span class="c0 c1">Commedia</span><span class="c0">), and that they would persist after his writing. We cannot be sure that Dante was reading mystical writing, but it is unlikely that his contemporary reader would be as struck by the conflation of eroticism and redemption as a reader of the 21st century may well be, for spirituality for us seems loosened from the passionate love so embedded in late medieval writing.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The language of the mystic would have been circulating in the broader Italian culture and the very erotic nature of texts that treat the divine, such as Dante&rsquo;s courtly love epic, would likely be in dialogue with these texts. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Petrarch, the other towering poet of the Italian 14th century, works in a more introspective manner than many of the poets who precede him. In describing Dante&rsquo;s approach to poetry, Giuseppe Mazzotta argues that Dante is on a quest for &ldquo;visionary poetry that would bind together various strands of experience against the partitions and fragmentations engendered by critical, analytical thinking,&rdquo; whereas Petrarch views poetry &ldquo;as the act by which fame is acquired and death is conquered&rdquo; (12). Indeed, Petrarch&rsquo;s conception of poetry can be perceived as a departure from the spiritually-minded work of his predecessor Dante, but ultimately they are both working with the idea of everlasting life. Petrarch, like his contemporary Catherine, travelled throughout Italy and to Provence, an itinerant poet. He wrote the poetry of his </span><span class="c0 c1">Rerum vulgarium fragmenta</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;over 40 years and continued to reorder the work, dealing more with fragments than the unified vision that Dante followed from his </span><span class="c0 c1">Vita nova</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;through the </span><span class="c0 c1">Commedia</span><span class="c0">. Though this poetry collection, famed for inspiring centuries of secular love poetry throughout Europe, may not popularly be read as a religious text, his 366 poems follow the 365 days of the liturgical calendar (with an introduction); he famously met Laura on Good Friday, and the last </span><span class="c0 c1">canzone</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is dedicated to the </span><span class="c0">Virgin</span><sup><a href="#cmnt19" id="cmnt_ref19">[s]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt20" id="cmnt_ref20">[t]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt21" id="cmnt_ref21">[u]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt22" id="cmnt_ref22">[v]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt23" id="cmnt_ref23">[w]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt24" id="cmnt_ref24">[x]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt25" id="cmnt_ref25">[y]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">. A suffering lover like his courtly predecessors, Petrarch bears a cross for Laura, which leads to suffering and a form of redemption. Though he is turned into himself, this is consistent with Catherine&rsquo;s own language of &ldquo;self-knowledge&rdquo; as a way to approach the divine.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The turn from Laura to the Virgin at the end of his </span><span class="c0 c1">Rime sparse</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;turns the work into a chain of love that operates between God and humankind. The Virgin is now the object of his love as she stands in as a figure marked by an intimate love relationship with God. The poem becomes a prayer, rife with ritualized and formulaic language that also recalls Dante&rsquo;s own prayer to the Virgin in </span><span class="c0 c1">Paradiso</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;XXXIII.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Speaking of Petrarch&rsquo;s fascination with monastic spirituality, Mazzotta writes, &ldquo;It can be said that Petrarch broadens the vast fields of theological reflection at the very moment when he confronts the figments of his vision and the demons of his own self. This is Petrarch&rsquo;s radical project&rdquo; (166). That is, Petrarch&rsquo;s religious writing like </span><span class="c0 c1">De otio religioso</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;do not do the same work that the </span><span class="c0 c1">Rime sparse</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;do truly to expand religious experience in a way that does not relegate it to confined spaces. This mediation between the divine and the secular is evident in Petrarch&rsquo;s poetic understanding of the Virgin (27-29):</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">Vergine pura, d&rsquo;ogni parte intera,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c3 c0">del tuo parto gentil figliuola et madre,</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">ch&rsquo;allumi questa vita, et l&rsquo;atra adorni</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The Virgin as mediatrix, who illuminates this life, and adorns the other, working between the poet and the divine, and as a paradoxical woman who is both daughter and mother of her offspring (and later &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">madre, figliuola et sposa</span><sup><a href="#cmnt26" id="cmnt_ref26">[z]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&rdquo; (47)), serves as a figure who complicates the many fragments of Petrarch&rsquo;s work and vision.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">As exemplified in the figure of the Virgin, one of the more striking aspects of Petrarch&rsquo;s poetry is his use of paradox and oxymoron, which is frequently employed in mystical writing. Catherine uses oxymoron in many instances to begin to describe her relation to God, or that which is ineffable. In her first </span><span class="c0 c1">Orazione</span><span class="c3 c0">, she sets up a series of binaries, showing how low a creature she is compared to her creator:</span></p><p class="c11 c13"><span class="c0">Tu, deit&agrave;, somma sapiencia, io ignorante e misera creatura, e tu somma ed etterna bont&agrave;; io morte e tu se&#39; vita, io tenebre e tu luce, io stoltizia e tu sapiencia, tu infinito e io finita, io inferma e tu medico, io fragile peccatrice che non t&#39;amai mai; tu bellezza purissima e io sozzissima creatura.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">The creature represents wretchedness, folly, death, darkness, ignorance and finiteness, while the creator represents all the opposite virtues. The opposing words occurring in close succession create a dizzying effect, and ultimately do not prove to be contradictory as the creature is made of the creator, so the divine (and conceivably the human) can occupy this paradoxical position. Similarly, Petrarch uses oxymoron and paradox throughout his </span><span class="c0 c1">Rime sparse</span><span class="c0">, notably in his Sonnet 134 that treats death and life, hate and love, imprisonment and freedom: &ldquo;Pace non trovo, et non &ograve; da far guerra; / e temo, et spero; et ardo, et son un ghiaccio&rdquo; (1-2).</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The speaker-lover is unable to find peace despite being done with war, and fears and hopes and burns and freezes. Like Catherine, Petrarch juxtaposes contradicting words against each other, to describe his current, love-struck dizzying state. Catherine takes love and hatred in turn as well, as she depicts the soul, which must feed on other souls (that is, winning them to salvation) in her </span><span class="c0 c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">: &ldquo;Dico che ella mangia, prendendo in cibo le anime sulla mensa della santissima croce&hellip; Dico che lo schiaccia coi denti, altrimenti non lo potrebbe inghiottire; lo schiaccia con l&rsquo;odio e con l&rsquo;amore&rdquo; (161).</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Invoking oxymoronic language to describe a paradoxical situation (a soul eating other souls in order to save them) is poetically fitting and makes it possible for Catherine to render this difficult experience in language. For many 14th-century writers, both earthly and divine love exist as experiences outside of the full range of human language, and they rely on literary devices like paradox to attempt to convey these personal events to </span><span class="c0">others</span><span class="c3 c0">.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The mingling of erotic and spiritual love within the context of literature is something that was likely enabled through the context of mystical writing that preceded the writing of lyrics and epics. As both types of love are ultimately ineffable, both poets and mystics attempt to approach their beloveds and their own subjectivity as the lover through similar literary devices ranging from allegory and metaphor through oxymoron and paradox. </span><span class="c0">In c</span><span class="c3 c0">onsidering texts from both a distant perspective through computational analysis and through a close reading with historical context, innovative approaches developed by both mystics and poets working in emerging vernacular languages are brought to light as they each grapple with describing the indescribable in order to reach others through their words.</span></p><p class="c6 c18"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c11 c18"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c11 c18"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c3 c0">E non vogliate sempre stare al latte: ch&egrave; ci conviene disponere i denti del desiderio ad ammorsare il pane duro e muffato, se bisognasse.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0 c24"><a class="c26" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ilpalio.siena.it/5/Personaggi/SantaCaterina/Lettere?L%3D118&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1487138961666000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyjlhDY_JeB0R386bcLESD5b715A">http://www.ilpalio.siena.it/5/Personaggi/SantaCaterina/Lettere?L=118</a></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c3 c0">Don&rsquo;t be satisfied to keep living on milk forever; we have to get the teeth of our desire ready to chew on bread that is hard and moldy, if necessary.</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c3 c0">Letter T118</span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c3 c0">To Caterina dello Spedaluccio and Giovanna di Capo, mid Aug to early Sept 1377</span></p><div><p class="c12"><span class="c3 c15"></span></p></div><hr class="c23"><div><p class="c5"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c8">&nbsp;The </span><span class="c8 c1">Commedia</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;is an epic poem, but Dante is from the Italian schools of lyric poetry, and this epic work is very much grounded in that tradition.
