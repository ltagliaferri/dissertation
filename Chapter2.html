This becomes most obvious in her letter-writing career, that consists of over 380 extant letters. Her letters to men and women have recipients located throughout Siena, Tuscany, and the Italian peninsula. Indeed, her reach extended beyond practitioners of the Italian language, as she corresponded with greater Europe through letters to the Avignon papal court; Charles V, King of France and his brother Louis, Duke of Anjou; Louis the Great and Elizabeth of Hungary. The heatmap of Catherine&rsquo;s recipients (below, interactive version available online), which takes into account the known locations of letter recipients (308 of the total), shows how Catherine&rsquo;s output radiates from Siena, reaches to the north and to the south, and trickles into Europe. This is also reflective of some of the travels that Catherine made during her lifetime, throughout Tuscany, to Avignon and to Rome. The spread of her letters does not speak only to geographical diversity, but to linguistic variety as well. Italian, a relatively new vernacular language, was even more formally varied at the time of Catherine&rsquo;s writing than it is in contemporary dialects today, as the language developed and clustered throughout what would become Italy. Catherine&rsquo;s recipients within Italy did not consist solely of native Italian speakers, as she wrote to the Englishmen William Fleet and John Hawkwood while both in Italy, the French-born Pope Gregory XI in his travel to and settlement in Rome, and many of her bilingual educated male correspondents may have been more accustomed to writing in Latin rather than Italian, especially as a lingua franca. </span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 584.10px; height: 353.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image05.png" style="width: 584.10px; height: 353.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2 c14"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/CatherineLetterMap&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1460179106324000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGyuEJlbeyv2ZAYQMyhNhaQaxt7TQ">http://bit.ly/CatherineLetterMap</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using digital network visualization to analyze Catherine&rsquo;s output through her extant letters renders some of the trends of her letter-writing career more obvious. Social network analysis investigates social structures, using nodes (people and things) and the ties that connect them to visualize data. In the visualization below (interactive version online), done in the statistical programming language R and the JavaScript D3 library, the nodes are comprised of letter recipients and letters, and the curved lines represent links between and among letters and their respective recipients. The nodes here are rendered as names of the recipients in text, and the letters are referred to by numbers as used in the Noffke edition of the letters. Time is also represented in this visualization, moving clockwise from the top with letter T61 and Agnesa Malavolti and the </span><span class="c1">Mantellate </span><span class="c2">(likely written before the plague of the summer of 1374), and follow through to letter T373 (written to Raymond of Capua on February 15, 1380), the break of which can be seen through the orientation of the text describing those nodes. Note that &ldquo;Raimondo da Capua&rdquo; does not appear next to letter T373, this is because recipients appear in chronological order based on the first instance that Catherine writes to them. When hovering over the name of a letter, the recipient(s) and the tie connecting the letter to the recipient(s) is rendered in a red-orange color, making it readily apparent which letters are being written to a single addressee, and which are addressed to a non-collective group. When hovering over the name of a recipient, the relevant letters addressed to him or her are displayed in a violet color, immediately displaying how many letters that recipient received, and whether the letters were clustered throughout Catherine&rsquo;s letter-writing activity or if they were limited to a particular time period. </span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 382.00px; height: 382.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image00.png" style="width: 382.00px; height: 382.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c14 c2"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lisatagliaferri.com/flare.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1460179106326000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEOpH3fjVULdYoAnIlCeMvHcCfFMw">http://lisatagliaferri.com/flare.html</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ties connecting letters and recipients will cluster more dramatically to certain recipients, it becomes more obvious who are the most important nodes in Catherine&rsquo;s written output. Though one would expect Catherine&rsquo;s confessor, Raymond of Capua, to play a significant role throughout her letter production (and we do have 16 extant letters addressed to him), a lot of activity can be seen with respect to some other recipients: Monna </span><span class="c2">Agnesa</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c2">, wife of the Florentine tailor Francesco di Pipino (and with whom she shares some addressed letters); Bartolomeo Dominici, a Dominican friar, sometimes confessor, travel companion, and who provides a testimony in the </span><span class="c1">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c2">; Neri di Landoccio Pagliaresi, a Sienese nobleman and poet, disciple, scribe, and eventual hermit, who was responsible for the earliest gathering and dissemination of Catherine&rsquo;s correspondence. Clustering around the times when they served as pope, Gregory XI received 14 extant letters between </span><span class="c2">1375</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;and 1377, showing the extent of Catherine&rsquo;s work to bring him back to Rome, with about 70% of the extant letters sent prior to his decision to return to Rome. Pope Urban VI received eight extant letters between 1378 and 1380, revealing a continued literary-based outreach and spirituality on Catherine&rsquo;s part after her great achievement of convincing Gregory XI to return to Rome. The Queen of Naples, Giovanna d&rsquo;Angi&ograve;, received seven extant letters between late 1374 and 1380, exemplifying Catherine&rsquo;s political involvement that persisted throughout, and likely drove her letter writing career at least in part. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of the correspondents with whom Catherine wrote were scribes, translators, writers and orators, collectors of her writing, and attested to her sanctity, Catherine successfully developed a literary network around herself. The community-building nature of Catherine&rsquo;s outreach and expression of religiosity are evidenced in the archive of letters that we have extant today. Of the nearly 400 letters that remain, 46.2% of the letters were addressed to more than one recipient. That is, for almost half of the letters that Catherine wrote, she intended more than one recipient, whether it was a group of the </span><span class="c1">mantellate</span><span class="c2">, a Sienese political group, or a husband and wife (as with the letters addressed to Francesco di Pipino, a Florentine tailor, and his wife Monna Agnesa). By writing to the plural </span><span class="c1">voi</span><span class="c2">, Catherine is consciously spreading her writing, connecting with many more recipients and getting more value and potential outreach for a single letter. Though there are some instances when she writes similar letters to different recipients (as when she writes to people she does not know well), she is more often writing to recipients who are already connected to each other, tapping into a community that connects through and radiates around her. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 593.81px; height: 365.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image03.png" style="width: 813.12px; height: 365.50px; margin-left: -219.32px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Indeed, Catherine works to further develop this community as the majority (73.7%) of her correspondents are the recipients of more than one letter over the course of her letter writing career. The remaining 26.3% of her extant letters are written to recipients who only received one known letter from Catherine, which in many cases is indicative of a one-off requirement of Catherine&rsquo;s, as when she wrote to a prostitute from Perugia on behalf of the prostitute&rsquo;s brother (T276). In other cases the recipients may have in fact received more than one letter but they are no longer extant. This is likely the case in letter T151b, which is no longer decipherable beyond the title of &ldquo;Frate&rdquo; for its having been overwritten so much. The overwriting is, however, indicative of a continued literary engagement with Catherine&rsquo;s texts, as people continue to interact with these physical objects that were collected and maintained to testify to Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality as well as her productive writing career. With all of this in mind, when considering the circular network diagram, it is important to realize that it is Catherine of Siena who is at the center of this network, serving as the connecting force among all of these recipients and letters.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 519.15px; height: 334.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image01.png" style="width: 744.16px; height: 334.50px; margin-left: -225.01px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Among the people in her community of literary exchange were female friends and disciples including Alessa dei Saracini, Francesca di Clemente Gori (often referred to by her nickname &ldquo;Cecca&rdquo;), Giovanna dei Pazzi, and Giovanna di Capo, who also served as her earliest scribes and who are recipients of several of her letters. Alessa dei Saracini, a young woman of a noble family who took the habit of Saint Dominic, served as a travel companion to Catherine and also offered her house in Siena as a place of refuge for her outside of the crowded Benincasa household. As a noblewoman, Alessa was educated at least in the vernacular language, and taught Catherine to read Italian (</span><span class="c2">Noffke</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span class="c2">). These women, including other female recipients of letters, are indicative of a female literacy throughout Italy and beyond, and also point to a literary network of women in the vernacular language. Though many of these women likely did not read and write in Latin due to their being precluded from masculine discourse, they were still capable at creating this broader community of written discourse and exchange in Italian.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 592.50px; height: 383.15px;"><img alt="" src="images/image02.png" style="width: 859.69px; height: 383.15px; margin-left: -267.19px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though women serve as a significant part of her community, they make up about a third of her letter correspondence, with men comprising the bulk of the recipients of her letters. This is likely due to women&rsquo;s lack of access to education, but also speaks to Catherine&rsquo;s ability to penetrate the more exclusive masculine religious community of her time, and how she did so through adept written exchange. During a time when the vast majority of Italian spiritual women were considered to be &ldquo;witches&rdquo; or otherwise transgressive in some way (King </span><span class="c2">145</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span class="c2">), Catherine was able to persuasively and successfully advocate for her authentic mystical experiences and knowledge of God. An instrumental figure in asserting and maintaining Catherine&rsquo;s reception and legacy was her confessor and advisor from 1374 on, Raymond of Capua (Raimondo della Vigne da Capua). Destined for a legal career and student of law at the University of Bologna, Raymond instead chose to enter into the Dominican Order while still a student in 1350. First assigned to Montepulciano, he served as chaplain to nuns of the Dominican Second Order in the monastery there. Agnes of Montepulciano, a former prioress of this monastery, was highly regarded by the community, and Raymond became her first biographer when he wrote of her life about 50 years after her death. Clearly, as someone educated in law and someone who was writing hagiography even before his encounter with Catherine, Raymond was a person who realized the power of writing. And in fact this writing proved to be fruitful as Agnes was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726. Raymond was sent next to Rome and then to Siena, where the Master General assigned him to be the spiritual director and confessor to Catherine of Siena, who was already a notable figure by the time Raymond began to work with her, and she in turn helped his career by causing him to be noticed by the pope. Because of his important relationship to her, Raymond received a large amount of letters from Catherine, including letters that describe important turning points in her life, including when she describes learning to write by her own hand (T272), and when she recounts the execution of Perugian Niccol&ograve; di Toldo in 1375 (T273). Becoming the Master General of the Dominican Order in the year of Catherine&rsquo;s death, he worked on the authoritative </span><span class="c1">viva</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of her life between 1385 and 1395. The result of this work, a hagiographical work that is known as the </span><span class="c1">Legenda maior</span><span class="c2">, would establish itself as the most influential biographical work on Catherine.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Among her male scribes were her disciples Francesco di Messer Vanni Malavolti, Neri di Landoccio Pagliaresi and Stefano di Corrado Maconi. Francesco, who was first a married nobleman then became a Benedictine, received only one extant letter of Catherine&rsquo;s, also provided testimony for the </span><span class="c1">Processo</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Castellano</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><span class="c2">, a document written compiled in the beginning of the 15th century and instrumental to the canonization of Catherine. Neri, as discussed above, received many of Catherine&rsquo;s letters, and had served to be an important correspondent for Catherine as he helped to secure her literary legacy through collecting and disseminating a group of her letters. Stefano was also responsible for a collection of Catherine&rsquo;s letters. A member of the lesser nobility of Siena and a travel companion, like Francesco he also provided one of the 24 testimonies to the </span><span class="c1">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c2">, and entered the Carthusian Order after Catherine&rsquo;s death. With two scribes among the men who collected Catherine&rsquo;s letters for posterity, as well as two who beared witness to her saintly acts, it is clear that her scribes greatly respected Catherine&rsquo;s good works and writing, honoring the latter through maintaining and circulating it.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the other correspondents of hers who provided testimony for the </span><span class="c1">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;are Bartolomeo Dominici, a Dominican friar, sometimes confessor and travel companion who received nine extant letters from Catherine; Martino, Abbot of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Michele in Passignano, who received two extant letters; Pietro di Giovanni Ventura, an early disciple who was converted by Catherine to become a Dominican friar and served as Catherine&#39;s emissary and also received two extant letters. Tommaso d&rsquo;Antonio da Siena, also known as Caffarini, was a very important figure in Catherine&rsquo;s life and her afterlife. Responsible for beginning work on the </span><span class="c1">Processo Castellano </span><span class="c2">through the solicitation of testimonies, and providing a testimony himself, Caffarini also campaigned to seek papal approval of the Dominican </span><span class="c1">mantellate</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and worked to develop and legitimize the saintly cult around Catherine of Siena (Ferzoco). A native of Siena, devoted follower of Catherine, and the director of the Sienese </span><span class="c1">mantellate</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in the year of her death, Caffarini proved to be extremely influential in promoting reform within the Dominican order, receiving recognition for the </span><span class="c1">mantellate</span><span class="c2">, cultivating Catherine&rsquo;s cult and verifying her sanctity (</span><span class="c2">Parsons</span><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;16). Together with Raymond of Capua, Caffarini is responsible for much of the hagiographical writing about Catherine in the decades after her death. Creating an abbreviated version of Raymond&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">Legenda maior</span><span class="c2">, called the </span><span class="c1">Legenda minor</span><span class="c2">, and he also wrote the much longer </span><span class="c1">Libellus de Supplemento</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to include additional biographical as well as hagiographical details about Catherine. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cristofano di Gano Guidini, a follower of Catherine&rsquo;s who did not fully commit to a religious life, choosing instead to marry and have children, served sometimes as a scribe for Catherine, according to Caffarini, and most importantly rendered her </span><span class="c1">Dialogo </span><span class="c2">into Latin (Luongo, </span><span class="c1">Saintly Politics</span><span class="c2">, 136). A Sienese notary who was active in politics, Cristofano was aware of what was required to gain legitimacy through text distribution in contemporary Europe. Though Catherine exercised control over her texts through use of the Sienese vernacular, Cristofano and Raymond &mdash; who wrote his </span><span class="c1">Legenda maior</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in Latin &mdash; and more than likely Catherine herself, realized that Latin translation would be necessary to realize true circulation of her writing. Were it not for this Latin translation by the notary Cristofano, who was also a writer of his own autobiography, the </span><span class="c1">Libro di memorie</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;which includes vivid recounts of his relationship with Catherine, the </span><span class="c1">Dialogo </span><span class="c2">likely would not have been later translated into Middle English for the nuns of the Syon Abbey. Though Catherine would always assert that spiritual priorities were more important ones, including in her letters to Cristofano, she likely understood that his political involvement was an important node of her larger network, and his spirituality proved to be more civic in nature, particularly in his devotion to the Spedale della Scala. Indeed, F. Thomas Luongo reads Catherine&rsquo;s tone in her letters to him not necessarily as reproachful, but suggests that it is only &ldquo;affectionate mocking of a follower whom she knew to be committed only so far&rdquo; (137). I believe that it is Cristofano&rsquo;s &ldquo;civic piety,&rdquo; as Luongo calls it, which leads to Cristofano taking action with the translation of Catherine&rsquo;s book, as he ensures that the educated elite and those with political power can read it and take it seriously.</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine, however, also exerted her own power over the afterlife of her texts, by entrusting her writing into the hands of Giovanni Tantucci, one of her early followers. A priest and scholar, likely educated at Cambridge along with William Flete, Giovanni was convinced by Catherine to &ldquo;renounce his comfortable worldly life as a priest and dedicate himself to the ascetic life&rdquo; as early as 1365 (Russell 79). He became part of the Augustinian hermit community of Lecceto, and Catherine probably was provided access to this network through Giovanni, and she would continue to correspond with this network frequently throughout her letter writing career (</span><span class="c2">Jorgensen</span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;146). Because of this long history, and likely because of his scholastic approach to religiosity, she had a great deal of respect for him and she entrusted him with her writings including her letters before her death (Noffke). He absolved her on her deathbed, and also delivered her eulogy. While Caffarini suggests that he was at a loss for words, his taking on the duties of her absolution and funerary oration suggests that he took care of her afterlife in every sense of the word, including of her work. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">In her last letter, written to Raymond, Catherine entrusts the </span><span class="c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in particular to four men; the addressee along with Bartolomeo de&rsquo; Dominici, Tommaso della Fonte and the &ldquo;Master&rdquo; Giovanni Tantucci (</span><span class="c2">T373</span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><span class="c2">):</span></p><p class="c10 c20"><span class="c2">Anco vi prego che il libro e ogni scrittura la quale trovaste di me, voi e frate Bartolomeo e frate Tomaso e il Maestro, ve le rechiate per le mani; e fatene quello che vedete che sia pi&ugrave; onore di Dio, con missere Tomaso insieme: nel quale io trovava alcuna recreazione.

This letter, explicitly dated February 15, 1380 in three manuscripts, is very likely her last dictated letter, written the same day as T371, which was also written to Raymond, but done in her own hand. What I would like to highlight here is that for Catherine her writing and her greater community are thought about nearly simultaneously &mdash; for her, this is her legacy, and she cares about what happens to both her writing and her </span><span class="c1">famiglia</span><span class="c2">. In requesting that several of her followers be responsible for her book and whatever other writing they can find, she ensures that there are several guardians to keep track of her archives. She has found &ldquo;recreazione&rdquo; in them, from the Latin &ldquo;recreare&rdquo; as in &ldquo;create again, renew,&rdquo; which would have been used similarly in Old French. In Middle English, &ldquo;recreation&rdquo; was more indicative of &ldquo;mental or spiritual consolation.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Italian etymology shows that </span><span class="c1">ricreare</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;deals with a sense of &ldquo;rianimare&rdquo; alongside rebuilding and restoration, but also with the joy that comes after the strain of rebuilding: &ldquo;ogni sorta di piacevolezze per distrarre l&rsquo;animo.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;If we think of her writing as a re-creation, it speaks to the reforms that she began to make in the Dominican Order as well as in her special kind of spirituality that engages with the community through good works and writing, and it can also speak to the reflection and the pleasure that can be found after doing this work. Together with her greater network, her </span><span class="c1">famiglia</span><span class="c2">, Catherine is able to spread the commitment to reform as well as the joy that can be found in recreating. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2 c17">2.

Eventually becoming known as the </span><span class="c1">Orchard of Syon</span><span class="c2">, the text may have been made available as early as 1420, which is also the year that first professions were made at Syon Abbey, five years after the placement of the foundation stone laid by Henry V on February 22, 1415 (Hodgson vii). The desire for a Bridgettine order in England likely began with the marriage between the daughter of King Henry IV, Phillipa, and the King of Sweden, Eric XIII of Pomerania. During her time in Sweden, Phillipa&rsquo;s head lady-in-waiting was the noblewoman Lady Katarina Knutsdotter who was also granddaughter of Bridget of Sweden, and Phillipa served as a benefactor of and frequent guest to Vadstena Abbey, founded by Bridget in 1346 (</span><span class="c2">Flemberg</span><sup><a href="#cmnt10" id="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;181-92). The Syon Abbey was a project that was as component of Henry V&rsquo;s effort to legitimize his dynasty, and proved to become the most important house for female religious established in England in the century prior to the Reformation. Being the only house in England of the Bridgettines or the Order of St Saviour, which was founded by Bridget of Sweden, it was indicative of the ongoing movement of the time that spoke to renewal and reform in spirituality. It enjoyed great funding by Henry V, took a stand against Henry VIII&rsquo;s project of the Reformation, and helped to develop Catholic recusant identity (Bainbridge 82). The role of Bridget of Sweden to the community should not be overlooked, as she was not a conventional saint, especially for contemporary English devotion at the time which was concerned with Lollardy. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably serving as a model for the English religious figure Margery Kempe, the noble-born Bridget was not a virgin but instead was a married woman who bore eight children and was widowed following a pilgrimage she took with her husband to Santiago de Compostela. Upon the death of her husband, Bridget joined the Third Order of St. Francis and devoted herself to a life of prayer, caring for the poor and the sick, and developing her community of double monasteries where men and women could live in poverty but still have access to books. In addition to her interest in texts and literacy, community-building, and her status as a tertiary nun, Bridget shared political aspirations with Catherine of Siena, traveling to Rome and working to return the papal seat there from Avignon. Along with being a biological mother, Bridget&rsquo;s spirituality clashed with English religiosity due to her status as a mystic and a non-martyr, important because martyrdom served as the chief criterion for English sanctity from the early Middle Ages through the Reformation (</span><span class="c2">Despres</span><sup><a href="#cmnt11" id="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup><span class="c2">). English devotional practices, especially for women, were very restricted and continental figures that managed to develop a career of public spiritual advocacy and mystical practices would not prove to be suitable models. Though Margery Kempe suffered for her public displays of piety, Julian of Norwich&rsquo;s position as an anchoress allowed her freedom to express her mystical experiences in texts. While 15th-century England does not immediately seem like a fitting environment for a figure like Catherine, not yet canonized, the local situation in the Bridgettine Syon Abbey seems like a more apt context for women to read an English translation of the </span><span class="c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c2">. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a text alone, the </span><span class="c1">Orchard of Syon</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;does not provide much available information and data regarding its provenance or the purpose behind it. Inevitably linked with the Syon Abbey and its nuns, it was likely intended for the first generation of these nuns specifically, and its primary translator was an anonymous one. This initial work was found within two copies according to an &ldquo;Envoy,&rdquo; was continued by another by the name of &ldquo;Dan Jamys,&rdquo; who may have been a monk in the Carthusian monastery of Sheen, across the Thames from the female Syon Abbey (Schultze 189). Though in many ways the text is a faithful one, the major changes are editorial in nature, which serve to completely recast Catherine&rsquo;s unique spirituality to one that is more in-line with traditional English expressions of devotion. C. Annette Grise&#769; maintains that &ldquo;framing materials&rdquo;&nbsp;&mdash; prologues, prefatory letters, woodcuts, incipits, explicits and title-pages &mdash; were deployed to establish what amounted to a spiritual provenance within Syon Abbey, leading to substantiating a form of legitimacy on the part of the community (136). </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Whether or not the prologue added this notion of a source, it is clear that the frame added to the </span><span class="c1">Orchard</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;served to allegorize the original Italian material, thus rendering Catherine&rsquo;s concept of the vineyard and communal vineyards instead into a monastic image of a cloistered garden, and placing a greater emphasis on the &ldquo;ghostly orchard&rdquo; and &ldquo;ghostly learning&rdquo; rather than an active spirituality based on doing good works in the world. In addition to the framing narrative, another editorial intervention occurs that restructures the rubric, moving away from the Italian formulation. In particular, the English version moves the treatise on tears from its own position within the colloquies, to being appended to the fourth chapter on &ldquo;Prayer.&rdquo; Despres contends that this movement decreases the significance of tears in Catherine&rsquo;s devotion and as a holy behavior independent of prayer, situating tears as a private form of worship and a component of praying in general terms (154). Though these interventions may be seemingly slight moves, and in many ways the women of Syon Abbey were still provided with access to the texts that Catherine originally wrote, rendered for them to read in their own vernacular language, the same textual control and attention to Catherine&rsquo;s unique spirituality that were components of her reception in the Italian tradition are not preserved in England. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the editorial changes done by the English translators of Catherine&rsquo;s dialogue suggest a closed-off and more private and contemplative approach to spirituality, the significance of a literate female community engaging with Catherine&rsquo;s texts should not be overlooked. The provenance of a Brigittine monastery certainly points to an interest in literacy, reading and books, and the Syon Abbey exemplifies this tradition with its great output and preservation of texts through the years, even maintaining them while they were exiled in Lisbon. Reading practices within the monastery were not limited to private devotion, and were structured throughout the day in various ways, with reading done silently and out loud, with the utilization of printed books and manuscripts, and both in communal spaces and privately in cells (</span><span class="c2">Bowden</span><sup><a href="#cmnt12" id="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt13" id="cmnt_ref13">[m]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;187). Of course, the women who would become the nuns and abbesses of Syon Abbey were from an elite class as they were able to read, unlike Margery Kempe who could not read and edit the autobiography she dictated to her scribes. And indeed, these women circulated the books of Syon Abbey with a complex network of female lay patrons. In part due to a Carthusian influence of the 15th century, the laity were able to in part imitate continental ecstatic women, and were also able to intersect with the texts coming out of religious houses due to their having family members placed there. Denise L. Despres names Cecily, Duchess of York and mother of Edward IV; Alianore Roos; and Elizabeth Sywardby as among the female lay patrons who were most interested in reading continental devotional works. Though this should not necessarily suggest an extremely wide readership of Catherine&rsquo;s work in English, the lay patrons who were interested in the textual production at Syon Abbey were likely the reason behind Wynkyn de Worde&rsquo;s 1519 printed edition of the </span><span class="c1">Orchard</span><span class="c2">. </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c17">Manuscripts</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two earliest extant manuscripts of Catherine&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">Dialogo</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;into English date from the first half of the 15th century: British Library MS Harley 3432, and Cambridge, St John&rsquo;s College MS C.25. The third extant manuscript is from the second half of the 15th century, Morgan M 162. There are additionally two manuscripts that contain a portion of the translation: an extract of part I, chapter 12 in Manchester, John Rylands Library, MS Latin 395; and an extract of part V, chapter 2 in Oxford, University College, MS 14 (Schultze 190). </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Library manuscript Harley 3432 includes an incipit by an anonymous cleric who was most likely Carthusian, addressed to the &ldquo;Religyuos moder &amp; deuoute sustren, clepid &amp; chosen bisily to laboure at the hous of Syon,&rdquo; positioning this book within the context of the Abbey in an immediate way. This manuscript is exquisitely decorated, particularly at its celtic-knot initials with red, blue, green and white ink, and gold leaf, and some initials are left unfinished. For each new part, there is an emphasis on the border around the two columns of text, setting the structural parts off as discrete units. Through marginalia in the book, and at the beginning and last pages that consists mostly of male autographs from the 16th and 17th centuries, it is clear that this book continued to be seen as a luxury item, if not a text to read, throughout its life before its inclusion in the British Library. Among the signatures is one from Walter D&rsquo;evereux, the 1st Devereux Earl of Essex. This became a book within John Batteley&rsquo;s collection, who was a Church of England clergyman and antiquary. The Harley Collection purchased Batteley&rsquo;s collection on November 5, 1723 (Wright 1966). Formed by Robert, Mortimer and Edward Harley, the Collection was bequeathed to Edward Harley&rsquo;s widow Henrietta Cavendish, then to their daughter Margaret Cavendish Bentinck, and was eventually sold to the nation of England in 1753, forming one of the foundation collections of the British Library. The lifecycle of the manuscript points primarily to masculine readership or at least ownership through the 16th and 17th centuries, and eventually returns to a female ownership before becoming part of a communal reading space more in line with its provenance. </span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 417.75px; height: 501.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image04.png" style="width: 455.73px; height: 528.55px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -13.89px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c14 c2"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMINBig.ASP?size%3Dbig%26IllID%3D24730&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1460179106348000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG63CLTtpBnlFxQ6WUzttjH3nYiRw">http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMINBig.ASP?size=big&amp;IllID=24730</a></span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cambridge, St John&rsquo;s College MS C.25 is in a much different style to the Harley MS, with plainer decoration and the vellum is smaller in size.

There is some sketched floral decoration in black ink in the margins, as well as banner illustrations to show continuing text for when sewing the pages together. There is some marginalia that highlights text with lines and curves, including playful marginalia that turns the curves into a face on 54r.
