Raymond mentions in his Legenda that Catherine had had desires to be a man herself, to cut her hair short and don male frocks, though Raymond himself clearly benefits from shaping Catherine into the ideal and cloistered female saint that she is not, as a weak vessel doing Christ’s work.  Webb interprets her focus on the heart as allowing for “expanded notions of gendered roles”, and a means for “figuring male and female together” (814). 
“crossdressing is imitation through transformation, with the result of becoming more like the deity being worshipped” (Bolich 207).  


“[Barbara] Newman’s observation about the importance of the male voice adopted by some women mystics as contrasted with the traditional gender reversal-language employed by male mystics (who often take on the female role as “soul-bride”) shows how gender-identity has often been malleable in the history of Christian mystical discourse. As Saskia Murk-Jansen has suggested, however, such gender reversals were fundamentally intended not so much to reflect preoccupation with gender identity as “to emphasize the fact that the soul’s relationship to God was like nothing they [they mystics] had ever experienced.” [“The Use of Gender and Gender-Related Imagery in Hadewijch” in Gender and Text in the Later Middle Ages, p. 53] The predication of feminine names (like minne) to God, as well as traditional male terms, points in the same direction — God lies beyond all distinctions of gender and the ordinary realms of consciousness. The rich developments displayed in what we might call the courtly mode” of mystical language … are not exhausted by these innovations regarding gender language.” The Flowering of Mysticism, Bernard McGinn p. 169


Chapter I
Born in 1347 of a wool-dyer father, Caterina di Iacopo di Benincasa chose a religious life against her family’s wishes. At 6 years of age, she had her first mystical vision of Christ, at 7 she made a vow of perpetual virginity to God, and at 21, she married Christ in a vision during which she received a ruby ring visible only to herself. In the years leading to her mystical marriage, she diligently practiced asceticism, which Suzanne Noffke describes as “silent solitude” and “cozy isolationism” (65). In her youth and adolescence, Catherine was largely private, occupying a small room in her father’s house, while practicing daily flagellations and extreme fasting. Because of the severity of her actions, and their effects on her health, Raymond tells his readers that her family required her to keep her door ajar (V, 52). As she had decided early in life to dedicate herself to God, Catherine had initially followed a traditional approach typical of hermitage and cloistering of oneself, a popular form of spirituality through the Middle Ages. Indeed, the 13th and 14th centuries found fertile ground for religious expression in the urban centers of Italy — especially in Siena — with male and particularly female recluses well supported by the city, and visible to society. In the year of Catherine’s birth, 80% of Siena’s recluses were women (Thurber 47). By the second half of the 14th century, urban reclusion, which existed on the boundaries of cities and the boundaries of institutionalized religion, began to decline, while the third order vocations were increasingly considered to be more appropriate channels for female lay religious expression (Thurber 72). Although Catherine had at first seemed content in her reclusive life, she was eventually compelled by God to lead a public life.[1]
While Catherine certainly spent her early years as an ascetic, her transition to communal space seems to have been grounded in her experiences. In her youth, she was attracted to the travelling Dominican preachers (Order of Friars Preachers) who came through Siena, and, as Raymond explains, Catherine so esteemed these Dominican friars that she longed to enter their Order to help guide people in spiritual matters. However, Catherine realized that her status as a woman would prevent her from joining them, leading her to consider following Saint Euphrosyne’s model to pass herself as a man (III, 38). As Carolyn Muessig notes, Catherine would eventually prove to be an “itinerant peacemaker, papal representative of sorts, spiritual counselor, theologian, and tireless letter writer” (4). And Raymond himself writes that “her life was to follow lines far different from those of other women,” as God sent her to live among people, working for others in public places (XII, 116). However, it was through communities of civic-minded and spiritual women that Catherine learned and flourished, and throughout her life she served as a community-builder and advocate to both secular and religious, regardless of gender. 
Catherine joined the Mantellate, a tertiary order of the Dominicans consisting of mostly widowed and married laywomen, when she was about 18 years old. The women at first did not want to accept her, as her status as a virgin was not typical of the order, but she was persistent and persuasive, as she would also prove to be in her subsequent political affairs. When Catherine first joined, she was still committed to prayer and solitude, but her work for the ill as a mantellata may have contributed in compelling her to leave her private space. The mantellate were dedicated to caring for the ill and doing good, and it was in hospitals that these groups of women gathered, the center of which in Siena was the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala, near the Duomo. As Jane Tylus notes, the hospital “...represented an intermediary space between public and private ... for the layperson dedicated to acts of mercy” (68). Because of Siena’s location on the Via Francigena, the ancient pilgrimage route to Rome, the mantellate cared not only for their geographical neighbors but also for many visitors. Thus, Catherine’s position as a lay Dominican proved to be beneficial though her initial desire to be in the mantellate may have seemed contradictory. In this position, she had access to larger circles of people through her affiliation with the Dominicans and was able to engage with people of the world by living outside of a monastery, not unlike her Italian predecessor, Francis of Assisi.
In 1374, Catherine first travels to Florence, and she spends most of 1375 in Pisa, where she cultivated a greater public reputation. While she had started constructing herself as a public figure in Siena, she generated excitement during her extended stay in Pisa and established herself as a public preacher and miracle worker (Capecelatro 107, Tylus 134). It is from Pisa that Catherine begins to engage in intense and frequent letter-writing, often addressing her spiritual and blood famiglia in Siena. In 1376 she travels to Avignon and is credited with the pope’s return to Rome in September of that year, proving herself as effectively engaged in politics. Still, as a woman in the public sphere, she was accused of vainglory, which Raymond sought to defend throughout the last chapter of his Legenda. As one may expect, this is a gendered issue, as Raymond notes her critics claimed, “‘She’s a woman. Why doesn’t she stay in her cell, if it’s God she wants to serve?’” (IV, 365). Raymond writes that both men and women are accusatory, but in the face of persecution she proved her sanctity through steadfastness, commitment to the public work of God, as well as her desire for martyrdom. Although he mentions Catherine’s companions often and writes of Catherine’s public outreach, he in some ways works to assert her as a solitary holy figure, committed primarily to working miracles and contemplation. 
Remarkably, for a figure we know today due to her own textual legacy, Raymond’s mentions of writing in the Legenda refer only to his own endeavors. When he discusses the act of reading, he primarily speaks to the present reader engaged with his text. However, according to the anonymously authored Miracoli di Caterina di Iacopo da Siena, Catherine read aloud to her fellow mantellate at supper time, which Tylus notes “situates Catherine in a world of women who, far from spreading snide words about her imagined sanctity, are listening to her read...” (127). Meanwhile, Raymond’s own Legenda major, Caffarini’s Leggenda minore and Processo Castellano, Stefano Maconi’s and the Pope’s letters — to name a few — are all indicative of Catherine’s participation not just in a female community but an active interlocutor of the male religious community as well. Her letters on practical matters (to a prostitute, a Jewish moneylender), political leaders (the Queen of Naples, the Queen of Hungary, the King of France) and concerning the justice system (T273) reveal her participation in wider civic society. Therefore, Catherine of Siena is not a mystic bound by her interiority and other-worldliness, but rather an active force in this world — her contemporary Italy — and a remarkable human who can operate outside and within societal constructs. 
Catherine wrote a number of texts, the work that seemed to have been the most significant to her was what she referred to as her Libro — the Dialogo della divina provvidenzia. This is a dialogue of 167 chapters between the soul who rises up and God, written a few years before her death during a period of about 13 months, between October 1377 and November 1378. The text generally concerns itself with the spiritual welfare of the reader and features significant thematic overlap with her letters. An important text within the context of publishing and readership, the Dialogo was first printed within the initial few years of the technology having been introduced within Italy, quickly following the printing of Bibles. The first printed edition was done by Azzoguidi in Bologna, and it has been printed about 70 times since then; meaning there has been about one edition for every 7-8 years (Cavallini[a]). Catherine’s prayers make up another set of her texts that were primarily written down by disciples during her ecstatic visions, mostly recorded in Rome, from December 1378 to 1380. Prayer 6, however, is described by Caffarini as to have been written in Catherine’s own hand at Rocca di Tentennano in the Val d’Orcia.[2] The collection of nearly 380 extant letters of Catherine’s reveal how she was a living saint embedded in her community, who developed and fostered a strong network of literary exchange. Her 10-year prolific letter-writing career began in 1370, with letters addressed to men and women, with recipients located throughout Siena, Tuscany, the Italian peninsula, and into Europe.
Catherine as Writer
        In his 1524 text De institutione feminae christianae, Juan Luis Vives explicates his curriculum for teaching the Christian girl — for his purposes, the future female elite of England. He mentions Catherine of Siena as among the virtuous exempla of Christian women in his chapter “On the Instruction of Young Girls.” As this work is dedicated to the English Queen Catherine of Aragon (mother of Queen Mary I), it would certainly have been remiss of him to not include her namesakes, first Catherine of Alexandria, then “The learned virgin of the same name, Catherine of Siena, [who] left fitting monuments of her genius in which the purity of her saintly intellect is resplendent” (IV, 25). The English translator and editor of the modern edition, Charles Fantazzi, issues a footnote here — “Catherine Benincasa … was not a very learned woman, as Vives states. She dictated her writings in the beautiful Tuscan vernacular of Siena…” (69). Though Vives may be cultivating the esteem of his patron here, what is interesting is that he is writing prior to Catherine of Siena’s designation as a Church Doctor — a title reserved for those who have contributed to theology or doctrine, and who are regarded as the great teachers of Catholic followers — and Fantazzi glosses the text with some “insight” about Catherine’s lack of learning after she had received this honor. 
Though she lacked a strictly formal education — of the kind that Vives put forth in his instruction manual — Catherine did set out to be educated in general terms, and to learn to read in particular. A friend and fellow mantellata, Alessa de’ Saracini (a woman!) served as her teacher, and Catherine did successfully learn to read the Tuscan vernacular, as well as physically write it in at least an elementary manner (Noffke, Vision Through A Distant Eye 40). As a noblewoman, Alessa was educated at least in the Italian language, and Catherine was wise to enlist the help of a woman from the higher classes to learn to read. Though Catherine is painted as a literate woman to various degrees throughout her biographies and hagiographies, the agency afforded to her literacy differs. Raymond writes, “I must tell you, reader, that this holy virgin knew how to read without being taught by human beings,” and continues to explain that Catherine was unable to learn through the assistance of her friend, but instead learned through divine miraculous intervention (79). While miracles make for a compelling case in efforts toward canonization, and divine teaching may be more appropriate for a holy woman during Catherine’s lifetime to gain respect, it is unlikely that a person putting her mind toward learning to read would be unsuccessful with patient guidance. Catherine learning from fellow women situates her inside of a community that is outside of traditional hierarchical modes of elite privilege, and instead contextualizes her as someone who both contributes to and benefits from this Sienese community.
Reading would serve Catherine throughout her life and spiritual devotion. As the text Miracoli di Caterina di Iacopo da Siena notes, she would read about the saints while at the table with her companions, as she would never eat a larger quantity than a nut (“ella legge delle cose de’ Santi , perocché tutte le cose che ella si mette in bocca recando in uno non farebbono quantità quanto una noce” (Valli[b][c][d][e] 9)). Throughout each of her days, she would also be sure to dedicate some time to reading (ibid.):
Tutto l’altro tempo del dì, poich’ è levata la mensa, ispende o in amaestrare genti di seguire la via di Dio, o in contemplare, et di stare rapita come di sopra è detto, o in leggere libri santi; ma il più suo tempo è quello della contemplazione, se ella fosse lasciata, perocché è molto visitata per divozione di genti che la vogliono vedere per pigliare assemplo et dottrina da lei.[3]
Throughout her day, she is in devotion herself, reading, in contemplation, in ecstasy, or people visit to learn from her —she is very much a part of a literate, teaching and learning community. Probably due to the construction of gender at the time, and following Raymond’s lead, this anonymous writer tries to emphasize Catherine’s commitment to contemplation. In this text, the many visiting people are almost described as a nuisance, but what is significant about their presence is that others are seeking knowledge from her, even if she is not considered learned in an exclusive elite sense of the word.
In addition to her reading, Catherine seems to have been successful as an auditory learner, attending scholarly preaching and instructional sessions designed for the Mantellate. For Catherine, writing and speech are never far apart, as both are methods to spread God’s Word. She had a very retentive memory as evidenced by her summoning of many Biblical passages from the Latin Vulgate Bible in her writing. This sharp memory causes one of her recent biographers and translators, Suzanne Noffke, to question Catherine’s command of Latin, which Raymond stated that she could read and pronounce (though not speak). It seems that Catherine has occasionally misquoted scriptures through corruption of her auditory reception of the texts. Still, her intellectual pursuit of Latin reading is evidenced in a letter from Tommaso Caffarini, a follower and biographer, in which he writes, “Mi dimandasti se quello verso del salmo: Domine non est exaltatum cor meum, vuol dire sicut adlattatus sanza el b, o sicut ablattatus col b”[4] (Leggenda minore 1868 253, as quoted in Webb 803). This indicates an attention to the Latin language as well as a processing of the meaning of Latin words. 
The founder of the Order of Friars Preachers, Dominic de Guzman (1170-1221), believed that preaching was best practiced out of a firm foundation in theology, and as part of his commitment to learning, he sent his brothers to be educated in Christian doctrine throughout the universities of Europe, wishing for them to recruit others to also be educated. The famous erudite Dominican friar, Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), was an influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism during his lifetime, and is now honored as a Doctor of the Church, like Catherine. This tradition of learning and education within the Dominican Order manifested itself in Catherine, as she propagated this legacy within her own practice. Her predecessor Thomas Aquinas was also there when she was taught by God to write in her own hand in Letter T272:
Questa lettera, e un’altra ch’io vi mandai, ho scritte di mia mano in su l’isola della Rocca, con molti sospiri e abondanzia di lagrime; in tanto che l’occhio, vedendo, non vedeva; ma piena d’ammirazione ero di me medesima, e della bontà di Dio, considerando la sua misericordia verso le creature che hanno in loro ragione, e la sua Providenzia; la quale abondava verso di me, che per refrigerio, essendo privata della consolazione, la quale per mia ignoranzia io non cognobbi, m’aveva dato, e proveduto con darmi l’attitudine dello scrivere; acciocchè discendendo dall’altezza, avessi un poco con chi sfogare ’l cuore, perchè non scoppiasse. Non volendomi trarre ancora di questa tenebrosa vita; per ammirabile modo me la fermò nella mente mia, siccome fa il maestro al fanciullo, che gli dà lo esempio. Onde, subito che fuste partito da me col glorioso evangelista Joanni e Tommaso di Aquino, così dormendo cominciai ad imparare. Perdonatemi del troppo scrivere, perocchè le mani e la lingua s’accordano col cuore.[5]
For Catherine, God is the ultimate master or teacher, but having both John the Evangelist, writer of a Gospel, and the learned Dominican Thomas Aquinas alongside her while learning the physical act of writing[6] shows her claim of a rich pedigree. However, due to her status as a woman at the bottom of conventional hierarchies, she also insists that she is ignorant, straddling a fine line between education and lack thereof. Though at the time, actually writing something down was largely considered a technical skill and scribes were often utilized to render thoughts on the page, Catherine sees her ability to write as a comfort and solace. When she is alone and without a scribe upon returning to the earthly realm from the height of divine mystical experience, through the act of writing, Catherine is able to pour out her heart onto the page rather than feel it burst.
        The heart is an important locus for Catherine, a metaphor she uses frequently in her writing, considering it to be a masculine body part that is simultaneously a source of nourishment, while also using the symbol for its religious and Aristotelian implications.[7] What is perhaps most fascinating about her descriptions of the heart is that she orients it accurately,[8] which is information that she would not have been able to glean from contemporary public depictions, according to Heather Webb, who explains that only anatomical descriptions of the heart oriented the organ properly during Catherine’s lifetime (“Catherine of Siena’s Heart” 804). As Catherine explains “how the literal shape of the heart reflects the ideal shape of human affections, with the greater portion directed toward heaven,” Webb argues that it becomes evident that Catherine utilized Dominican encyclopedic sources, drawing from Antonio Volpato’s research[9] on Catherine’s drawing from these Dominican encyclopedias that often contained depictions of physiology (“Catherine of Siena’s Heart” 805). Catherine is not the only mystic to have been intrigued by science, and biology in particular, as Hildegard of Bingen wrote on scientific and medicinal uses of natural objects in both Physica and Causae et Curae,[10] and Teresa of Ávila punctuates her Libro de la vida with symbols of water, soil and nature to describe what María M. Carrión refers to as “sustainable devotion[f].” While Catherine’s utilization of Dominican encyclopedic sources further confirm her own literacy, it also indicates a general interest in learning that is not limited to reading and writing. Her seeking out of knowledge about the natural world alongside theology points to a commitment to greater understanding and sharing of that knowledge through teaching. As she is able to learn both in the traditional sense of listening, reading, and speaking with the educated famiglia that she cultivated around her, but also gleans a special knowledge through mystical experience, she seeks out public speaking and writing to help others gain from what she has learned and what she has taught (and likewise others seek her out). 
Despite her efforts to learn across fields, gaining the knowledge in and writing using the vernacular language was not considered to be true literacy in a Latinate world. Though Catherine was born half a century after Dante had written De vulgari eloquentia, little had changed regarding the status of the Italian and Latin languages, and what participating in those language communities meant. Latin — the language of upper-class men, intellectual humanists, and the church — presented a clear barrier that prevented common people and women in particular from accessing information. Though Catherine was interested in participating in the same language as this separate and self-monitoring exclusive group (as is evident of her efforts to learn Latin), she consciously and emphatically would choose Sienese Italian as her language of writing and speech. As a religious figure doing good work in the world, offering comfort, advice, and care to the prisoners, penitent women, and ill of Siena, how could she choose to communicate in a language they would not be able to understand? Having learned to write through her own community, and being a publicly-engaged woman who addressed her fellow Sienese in speeches in the piazza or through dispatched letters, Catherine was working to include the poor, sick, uneducated and sinful, rather than exclude them. As both a learner and a teacher of God, tasked with delivering messages of the divine to others, the local language of her time was incredibly instrumental to gain followers and communicate. Indeed, her use of language is remarkably similar to Francis of Assisi’s equity-driven approach to spirituality, as he wrote what are considered to be the first Italian language texts as a means to engage all those in his community who could not understand Latin. His prayer-song, “Cantico delle creature,” even extols the disenfranchised group of non-human animals, appreciating their dignity in being the creatures of God.[11] Catherine’s use of language is consistent with her spirituality (as well as Christ’s inclusive teachings), which is public, community-based, and poetic while also being meaningful and significant. 
Where Catherine did exclude by language was in letters she wrote in her native Sienese to prominent foreign men and women who likely had little or no grasp of Italian. In response to this, Raymond notably would send an accompanying messenger to Pope Gregory XI in order to interpret, viva voce, Catherine’s words into Latin, thus creating a performative and multivalent text (Tylus 161). Though this may be viewed as an intent to diminish Catherine’s Italian, especially when considering that Raymond also quickly worked to have her Libro translated into Latin, this was actually an effective method for retaining Catherine’s agency and community-focused ideals while also accommodating the Pope. As with all of her language-based choices, Catherine’s use of the vernacular in her letters, especially those addressed to the Pope, serves not only a literary choice, but also a political one: Catherine’s activities were directed towards returning the papal seat from France to Italy (Tylus 162). Similarly, Raymond’s work was invested in Catherine’s canonization, and he was well aware that for a female mystic to access the church hierarchy in this way, she would have to be presented in the language of the elite rather than the language of the people. Translating texts into Latin also ensured the circulation of texts across linguistic boundaries, as they could subsequently be translated into local vernaculars (as with the translation of Catherine’s Libro and Raymond’s Vita into English, discussed below). Italian women religious, like Angela of Foligno and Elena da Udine, did not enjoy the same relatively quick canonization that Catherine did, as most of the texts surrounding their lives were in the vernacular. Angela of Foligno (d. 1309) was not canonized until 2013 by the current Pope Francis, and Elena da Udine (d. 1458), whose notarized vernacular life was written by Simone da Roma, was only beatified after[g] Giacomo da Udine’s interesting Latin text that focused on her ascent into heaven (Vita Helenae utinensis).[12] 
Although today we may consider authorial dictation to not be quite the same skill as writing, it is worth noting that the great English poet John Milton was blind by the time he wrote Paradise Lost from 1658 to 1664 (with the second edition written in 1674), and “Contemporary accounts relate that Milton, whose eyes finally failed completely in 1651, would dictate to his daughter Deborah, his nephew, or a paid amanuensis every day” (Farmer 19). There are numerous paintings of Milton dictating to his daughters, including the 1826 painting by Eugène Delacroix, suggesting a romanticizing of the oral epic nature of the text, which calls to mind the great works of classical poets like Homer, but also shows an intimate community between writer and scribe. Also, these paintings do not seem to call into question the fact that the one who is manually writing is female, with authorship remaining firmly with the esteemed male poet Milton. However, this charming literary tableau is not afforded to Catherine. As a driving force of her monograph, Reclaiming Catherine of Siena, Jane Tylus problematizes Catherine as a “producer of words,” only trying to claim that she was “certainly a woman intrigued by the technology of writing and interested in exploiting it for a variety of spiritual reasons” (18). Tylus mentions Stephen Botterill as among the dissenters to Catherine as writer, and it is worth quoting his gloss in the Cambridge History of Italian Literature (considered to be a standard scholarly text) at length (125):
In all these writings Catherine handles the vernacular with subtlety and force, commanding a wide range of tonal registers and using her expressive medium with supple ease and pithy eloquence that make her letters, in particular, one of the monuments of epistolary tradition. But the idea of Catherine as “author” of her own texts bring with it several extra-literary problems that affect interpretation. Born and raised in working-class poverty, and subject, like nearly all women of her century, to virtually complete exclusion from the realm of education and literate culture, she learned to read and write only near the end of her life. Most if not all of her “writings” were thus orally dictated to (male) secretaries, foremost among them the famous friar Raimondo da Capua. It is by no means clear exactly what role these secretaries played in editing, revising or otherwise preparing Catherine’s dictated texts for circulation in manuscript; and any conception of Catherine as a woman writer of the Trecento — a rara avis indeed — needs to be modified by attention to the individual and social realities that govern her work, and which include substantial involvement by men in the preservation of that work in written form.
There are quite a few assumptions made on Botterill’s part here, which stem from a discourse that must modify the woman writing as a “woman writer” rather than a “writer.” Although he will grant that Catherine effectively “handles” language (he does not state that it is her scribes doing this handling), he will not afford her authorship. The neologism “working-class” is anachronistic and unclear — her father was a wool-dyer, a skilled worker and likely providing more than poverty for his family as part of Italy’s growing artisanal class. As is noted in her biographies, Catherine’s family provided her with her own small room within the familial house in which to pray, a luxury not indicative of a poor father. Catherine, a mystic and future saint, chose the life of poverty for herself rather than marry. It is also assumed that education was limited to the realm of a formal education, and that a knowledge of reading and writing could not be attained outside of elite male institutional study. Even the fact that Catherine went to fellow women to attain literacy suggests that a grassroots-style education could be realized by women and the non-elite living in Siena during her time. Reserving the title of “teacher” or “master” for Christ alone, Catherine clearly was not participating in the same kind of educational system that Botterill describes (Noffke 58). The “literate culture” he refers to is likely the Latin literacy discussed above, a literacy that was exclusionary and inequitable. The note of “(male) secretaries” is also inaccurate, as Catherine employed secretaries from both sexes, as is evidenced in many letters that state which women are there with her.[13] Though the men around her worked to promote Catherine’s spirituality and sainthood, there is little to indicate that they would mishandle her texts — they are part of her famiglia and go to her for advice, why should the assumption be that they would change her words when they, part of Latinate culture, do not prevent her from writing in Italian? 
Concluding that Catherine has little or no control of her dictated texts based on little evidence while assuming that men who used scribes had full control is a problematic stance. While we do not have writing extant in her own hand, we also do not have much of the writing in the hand of male writers from her period, either (including Dante and Francis of Assisi[h][i]). Writing in a communal setting is exactly what we may expect from a figure so embedded in her city and culture, and though in some letters she notes when she writes in her own hand, writing as a solitary and scholarly pursuit alone does not truly capture the full range of the nature of writing. Collaborative writing, as with collaborative visual art, was among the expressions of writing and the arts through the Middle Ages and Renaissance (acknowledging collaborative writing is integral to our understanding of Shakespeare[14]), and to afford some collaborative negotiation as part of Catherine’s writing process is not to diminish her writing and authorship any more than male writers who are also likely not writing entirely alone and never sharing or receiving feedback on their work, which is also likely edited by others. If we are to contextualize Catherine, as Botterill suggests we do, it is to reveal her as a writer of her own time, part of a growing discourse of writing in the developing Italian language, and among the innovators of that language, employing unique and consistent metaphors and imagery while also persuasively enacting diplomacy — indicative of both her poetic prowess and rhetorical style.[15] Writing has always proven to be a site of collaboration and negotiation, and this persists to this day; if we are to problematize Catherine’s authorship, we must also problematize authorship in general, which has a long theoretical history, but is outside of the scope of this present study. For this work, the stance that will be taken is the stance that is afforded to male writers.
The Figure of the Mystic
Catherine of Siena, as a writer and reader, student and teacher outside of traditional and established elite hierarchies, proves herself to be a liminal figure, pushing against conventional norms while also capable of moving through and working within prescribed systems. Her success as a writer, as a religious figure, and as a saint, depended very much on her ability to construct herself in ways that were within and without acceptable boundaries for what a 14th-century Italian woman were. In many ways, her robust efforts at community building served her well throughout her life and continued to serve her in the construction of her legacy. But another aspect of her life also clearly guided her spirituality as well as her approach to writing and even her community development: mysticism. Understanding Catherine as a mystic is crucial for contextualizing the reasons why she engaged in so much outreach, and how writing fit into her religiosity and social justice-driven approach to faith. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the figure of the mystic: how the mystic is theoretically cast as a transgressive figure at the borders of binaries but also outside of them. Thinking about Catherine in these terms will enable us to move forward with her writing from the theoretically grounded perspective that she is functioning within and without the boundaries of male and female, human and divine, sanctioned and unsanctioned.
A year before his death, Sigmund Freud writes a single sentence in an entry dated August 22, 1938: “Mysticism is the obscure self-perception of the realm outside the ego, of the id[j]” (“Mystik de dunkle Selbstwahrehmung des Reiches ausserhalb des Ichs, des Es”). Though Freud wrote on mysticism throughout his life, he did not view it as a means to religious redemption, but seemed to couple it more with psychoanalysis itself, as a way to know that which exists outside of the ego, in direct contact with the id.[16] In general, Freud sees mysticism as irrational and in lack of an organizing language, while still probing at an intellectual problem that cannot be grasped by the rational self. Though many theorists will agree with its irrationality and further identify the mystic as a pathological figure, others view mysticism to be a domain into which a specific language is explored and brought to light, beyond the boundaries of learned and self-conscious speech and writing. For feminist theorists, the language is largely charged with amorous expression due to mysticism being intrinsically joined with femininity and a state of loving and even eroticism. 
        In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir characterizes the mystic as a lover desirous of [k]Christ, associated with blood and self-annihilation, and ostensibly a woman. As part of Beauvoir’s argument throughout the broader text, love is assigned to woman as her supreme vocation — that is, she is defined by the loving she does. When a woman loves a man, Beauvoir explains, she is seeking God in this man. Man is the representation of God (or the logos), and as Lacan further demonstrates, “The phallus is the signifier of signifiers, the privileged signifier of that mark in which the role of the logos is joined with the advent of desire” (Écrits 287). For man, reason and desire and the logos are conflated, but as woman is without the phallus, she is relegated to the lover, only capable of desiring the logos, typically in the form of a man. If, Beauvoir writes, human love is denied to her — whether due to her having been disappointed in love, or her having been too selective in choosing a lover — she may seek the logos in the person of God himself. Interestingly, by choosing to direct herself to God, the female mystic is superseding the intermediary force of the male human and is encountering the logos unimpeded, desiring this true signifier of signifiers rather than the corporeal representation of God found in man. The female mystic using love (even desirous love) as a vehicle toward desiring and comprehending the logos is exactly in line with Christian theology, as Dante[l][m][n] so aptly illustrates in erotic language throughout Paradiso[o] by borrowing from the eroticism inherent in the biblical Song of Songs and hagiographies (e.g., St. Francis marrying Poverty).[17] The blending of caritas and eros as a method for approaching the divine and thus the logos or God is a legitimate expression of faith that simultaneously disrupts psychoanalytic gendering of women through their channeling of desirous love to encounter the logos unmediated by masculine accoutrements.
Much of the tension surrounding the mystic in theoretical inquiry pivots around the perception of the mystic as an hysterical figure. Hélène Cixous views the mystic as being aligned with hysteria rather than religiosity — a non-mystical religious woman, for Cixous, is an obsessive-compulsive, whereas an hysterical woman is an artist and revolutionary. In my reading, and as Amy Hollywood notes in general terms, theorists typically denigrate the affective and expressive embodiments of mysticism, though the rare exceptions (Bataille, Beauvoir, Lacan, Irigaray) view these women less pathologically and instead as subversive figures who can effectively merge action and contemplation, emotion and reason, body and soul. Teresa of Avila and Angela of Foligno are discussed in particular throughout theoretical writing on mysticism, and Simone Beauvoir specifically writes on Joan of Arc and Catherine of Siena as well. 
On Catherine of Siena, Beauvoir in fact mentions her prior to discussing the mystic in particular, when she addresses the special status of queens and saints, who, she argues, were afforded more social support than other women and granted equality. Women she mentions in this regard include Clotilda, Radegonde, Blanche of Castile, Heloise, Joan of Arc, along with Catherine (104). As an Italian woman, Catherine is mentioned again when Beauvoir discusses how women made gains during the Italian Renaissance; she argues that there is individualism available for everyone regardless of sex, and that women became powerful sovereigns, military leaders, artists, writers and musicians (105). When she writes on the mystic in chapter 24 (670-678), in which she mentions Catherine on several occasions, she discusses how the mystic tries to annihilate herself, while also being especially concerned with blood, setting up an interesting mystical obsession with corporeality that is both a denial and a preoccupation with bodily fluid. For mystics, “Ecstasy mimics corporeally that abolition of the ego,” that is, whereas other loving women may abolish only their psychological egos, mystics also annihilate their flesh (675). 
However, they are also especially concerned with blood, which Beauvoir claims is part of indulging in “sado-masochistic fantasies,” and mentions that “St Catherine of Siena refers to [Christ’s blood] in most of her letters” (676, 677). Of course, Catherine evokes the blood of Christ within the rhetorical structure of every one of her fully extant letters. As a liminal figure between the middle ages and the early modern period, Catherine is very much engaging with a form of medieval devotion that is concerned with Christ’s blood, and referring to this as sadomasochistic is certainly an anachronistic reading. What is more unsound about Beauvoir’s analysis on the mystic is that she writes, “To be sure, there have also been men who burned with that flame, but they are rare and their fervor is of a highly refined intellectual cast, whereas the women who abandon themselves to the joys of the heavenly nuptials are legion, and their experience is of a peculiarly emotional nature” (670). I say this is unsound, because not only does it incorrectly estimate the number of male mystics (of which there are many more male mystics than female mystics[18]), but also because it sets up a false dichotomy of mystical expression. What is not intellectual about Hildegard and Catherine? What is not emotional about Bernard of Clairvaux and Francis of Assisi?
Where Beauvoir’s examination is rich and vital is when she discusses the relationship between action and contemplation, which is what gets at the heart of Catherine’s mysticism. Beauvoir maintains that for some women, “Ecstasies, visions, talks with God — this inner experience is enough,” but that “[o]thers feel impelled to transmit it to the world through acts” (677). She further explains that these are “women of action [. . .] who know very well what goals they have in mind and who lucidly devise means for attaining them: their visions simply provide objective images for their certitudes” (678). For Beauvoir, Teresa of Àvila is the preeminent embodiment of this mystical sensibility, but she includes Catherine of Siena and Joan of Arc among the women who use contemplation to fuel their action in the world. What is significant here is that there is a balance and an occupation of a liminal space between contemplation and action. Where many religious figures are revered for their meditative approach to spirituality, mystics are typically engaging with the wider world in some way, to transmit their knowledge through text, or to be involved in doing charitable and political works for wider social good.
As Beauvoir does dwell on Catherine of Siena in her text, it is worthwhile to quote her assessment of the mystic at length (104):
… the story of St Catherine of Siena is significant; in the midst of a quite normal existence she created in Siena a great reputation by her active benevolence and by the visions that testified to her intense inner life; thus she acquired the authority necessary for success, which women usually lack. Appeal was made to her influence in exhorting those condemned to death, in bringing back wanderers, and in allaying quarrels between families and cities. She had the support of a society that recognized itself in her, and thus it was that she could fulfill her mission of pacification, preaching from city to city submission to the Pope, keeping up extensive correspondence with bishops and rulers, and in the end being chosen by Florence as ambassadress to go to seek out the Pope in Avignon.
Catherine’s “active charité” is juxtaposed with her “visions qui manifestent son intense vie intérieure,” but rather than occupying two different aspects of Catherine’s approach to life, they support and drive each other (169). As a person driving works of charity and spiritual policy, Catherine was an inherent element of her community, and she reflected back the community she was a part of and helped to maintain. As Beauvoir sees Catherine, the active life and the contemplative life are impossible to disentangle, and serve as the foundation of Catherine’s mysticism.
        Catherine’s own texts adroitly blend the active with the contemplative, emphasizing her act of doing good works in the world as part of her spirituality. In a letter to the Dominican abbess and nuns of San Pietro in Monticelli a Lignaia in Florence, she writes (T79):
E non lassi la buona operazione con santi desiderii, nè per tentazione del dimonio, nè per fragilità della carne … E non debbe lassare il servire al prossimo suo, nè di cercare la salute sua, per ingratitudine nè per ignoranzia, che non cognoscesse il servizio. Non debbe lassare; perocchè, se lassasse, parrebbe che cercasse d'essere retribuito da loro, e non da Dio: la quale cosa non si debbe fare, ma prima eleggere la morte.[19]
For Catherine, doing good is intrinsically tied to holy desire, and nothing should prevent the servants of God from serving their neighbors, whether it is corporeal weakness or their neighbors’ ingratitude. She emphasizes that their fellow earth-bound humans cannot offer them a reward, so they should not seek one from them but from God through eternal life. This letter, which Noffke dates to October 1377, is contemporaneous with Catherine’s writing of the Dialogo, and this sentiment of loving thy neighbor through service is reiterated in a statement of God’s in Dialogo 7:
come io non voglia altro che amore, poiché l’uomo esercita l’amore del prossimo nell’amore di me. Quando ha adempiuto il precetto dell’amore del prossimo, egli ha osservato la legge, e coi legami di questa dilezione, potendo, farà utlità agli altri secondo il proprio stato.[20]
Being useful to others is the proper state for followers of God, for when people love each other they are showing love their creator, and upholding his law. This service or active charity is such a crucial component of Catherine’s mysticism and general outreach, that she includes it in her advice letters directly to others as well as well as early on in her Dialogo which is intended for all to read and learn from.
[more on Catherine’s self-portrayal and involvement of the vita activa, blended with Frazier, why are you bringing Frazier into this]
 In Possible Lives: Authors and Saints in Renaissance Italy, Alison Knowles Frazier discusses how what is emphasized in Renaissance hagiography shifts from an other-worldly spirituality to a this-worldly spirituality, focused on a male vita activa and reforming manifestations of religious life outside the cloister and in the city. Figures like St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Ambrose, St. Potitus and St. Nicholas are profiled in particular, and the Latin humanist writers generally prefer the male subject to the female, with about 5% of Dominican accounts and 25% of Franciscan accounts being about women (Frazier 35). 
With a shift toward the active life in narratives of male religious, we cannot say that the blending of action with contemplation is entirely the domain of the female mystic. In fact, many women in the medieval and early modern periods would have been entirely precluded from having a “this-worldly” active life whether religious or not. Aristotle develops the crucial distinctions between zoe and bios, oikos and polis, limiting women to the realms of zoe (the biological life outside of politics) and oikos (the home), whereas men inhabit the domains of bios (the qualified life, the life of society, and political life) and polis (the city). Though there are some women who are societally sanctioned to engage in public life — like Mary Magdalene, Joan of Arc, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Vittoria Colonna — the vast majority of women through the Renaissance were unable to participate in the political life of the city, including those who claimed to have a higher divine impetus for doing so. In Women of the Renaissance, Margaret King notes that between the years of 1300 and 1700 “witches” in Italy outnumbered religious women 100 to 1, revealing that women who attempted to be viewed as religious and spread the word about their sanctity were much more frequently viewed to be demonic, an accusation that Catherine herself had even endured by some skeptics (described by Raymond as her “disparagers” (176-7)), though she is distinguished as a Church Doctor today (145).[21] Even earlier female mystics like Hildegard [p]of Bingen lead remarkable lives pursuing multivalent approaches to knowledge production and creative works, yet were proscribed from a public life outside the cloister apart from their letter writing endeavors. Though letter writing could be interpreted to be a subversive form of political engagement, and continues to be an important method of communication for later mystics and Catherine of Siena in particular, there is still a lack of public presence and public voice. Famously, a portion of Hildegard’s Scivias were read aloud by Pope Eugenius III to assembled clergy, revealing how even a medieval woman’s writing could participate in public performance, though the female voice of the writer is left unheard (Logan 175). 
Like Beauvoir’s description of the woman intellectual[q], the mystic or even religious woman is othered twice: first she is an outsider contained within zoe, secondly she is an outsider for being something that is “sacred.” In Roman law, the homo sacer is one who cannot be sacrificed yet can be killed without the killer being condemned for homicide — those that are sacred belonging to the class of those who exist outside of society (Agamben 47). Priests, hermits, the sacrificial and the gods all exist outside of bios, outside of society and in a state of exclusion. Yet, all except God(s) are in some ways included in the form of exclusion — what Agamben describes as “the ambiguity of the sacred” — these sacred men are in some ways within and some ways without (50). Ambiguity consistently lies within the construction of the sacred, with overlapping between the holy and the unclean, for instance, which is an even more historically difficult line for women to negotiate. This being because the femina sacra, doubly without political life, is rendered twice removed. The “witches” killed throughout history for being part of this femina sacra classification suffered due to their twice-othered status, yet without any ramifications for those who killed them — in most cases the state. Though some very few feminae sacrae were fortunate enough to successfully escape death by the state, this may have been due to their amplified outsider status. As sacred women, they were completely outside the world of man, just like God,[22] and were therefore closer to the word of God, viewed more often as a conduit for God’s word in their mystical writing, than as a mediatrix channeling the logos.
As men were typically able to to express their religious authority through learning, citation, rhetoric and public engagement, they were not limited to the “prophetic, visionary, or mystical claims [that] were the primary modes of religious authorization available to women” (Hollywood, “Gender, Agency” 514). On the figure of the male mystic, Lacan writes, “There are men who are just as good as women. It does happen. Despite, I won’t say their phallus, despite what encumbers them on that score, they get the idea, they sense there must be a jouissance which goes beyond. That is what we call a mystic” (“God and the Jouissance” 147 / S XX p. 76). Here, Lacan ties mysticism to bodily experience that is a painful pleasure (for him, beyond the phallus), an eroticism that could be said to be described frequently in mystical writing. Though corporality and perceived sexual difference are subjects touched upon by mystics, along with images of sensually felt divine love, there is also at play a complication of gender throughout many mystical and religious texts that suggest that there is an aspect of mysticism that goes beyond not just jouissance but also beyond a dichotomic gender binary. As Anne J. Cruz writes, “female mystics verbalize a uniquely Christocentric position that both transgresses and transcends gender order,” and I would add this to mystics in general, not just that male mystics participate in jouissance, but are equally inhabiting a complicated space that is both pushing at the boundaries and beyond the construction of gender[r] (134).
Running parallel yet divergent to the other creation stories of Genesis,[23] the book of the generations of Adam, Genesis 5, reads, “In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created[s]” (1-2). That is, from the beginning, male and female are part of Adam, and are also, presumably, part of God, as Adam is created in God’s image. This rings remarkably similar to Aristophanes’s creation tale of the three sexes as described in Plato’s Republic, except that in Genesis 5 there is only one sex comprised of both male and female identity. Perhaps, like the four-legged androgyne of Aristophanes, the female part of Adam was excised to form Eve, and we have since inherited a double-sexed notion of gender which was largely enforced in the Middle Ages and early modern period. Yet, from these early religious texts, there is enough scope for two genders to exist in one body, suggesting a complication of gender from the very creation stories that propagate the Judeo-Christian tradition. Raymond reports that when Catherine spoke to God about her misgivings of being female,[24] God replied (90):
Am not I He who created the human race, and divided it into male and female? I spread abroad the grace of my spirit where I will. In my eyes there is neither male nor female, rich nor poor, but all are equal, for I can do all things with equal ease.
Though Raymond’s description of God’s words are somewhat contradictory, but is in line with Genesis 5. Even if God divided humanity across male and female gendered lines, he indicates that he does not see them as separate or unequal beings, nor does he judge humans based on their economic status.
From a linguistic perspective, the situation of the soul is decidedly feminine as the Latin word “anima” is a feminine word. Thus, mystical writers like Jerome, Gregory of Nyssa, Thomas Aquinas (in Summa theologica as well as De anima) and Bernard of Clairvaux view the soul as intrinsically feminine. For those writing in the vernacular, Meister Eckhart uses the German feminine noun “Seele,” and Catherine and Teresa of Avila will adopt the feminine “a/ánima” in their native Italian and Spanish, respectively. Though linguistic gender may not seem particularly remarkable, it is worth noting that Bonaventure opts for the Latin masculine word “mens” (mind) rather than “anima,” and that Bernard of Clairvaux speaks of himself and his fellow monks in feminine terms throughout his writing, perhaps informed by the gendered language in addition to the hierarchical position of the worshipper who approaches the divine (Harmless 49, 85). Indeed, Bernard’s Sermons on the Song of Songs[t] speak to the malleability of the reader’s gender, as the presumably male reader must place himself in the position of the presumably female bride — allegorically the Church — to the presumably male bridegroom of Christ.[25] In this text, he describes being kissed on the mouth by Christ, and remarks on his female corporeality including breasts that swell with milk (2.2, 9.2, 9.7[u]).[26]
Famously, Bernard is also tied to breast milk due to his mystical vision known as Lactatio Bernardi in which the Virgin Mary intervenes on his behalf, perhaps to cure an eye infection, by either shooting her milk into his eyes, or dripping it into his mouth. In his chapter on “Bernard and Mary’s Milk,” Brian Patrick McGuire details a number of stories and visual art treatments that center around Bernard or another unnamed monk from Clairvaux, and James France notes that Bernard was not the only non-Christ figure suckling Mary’s milk as this became a “widespread theme in collections of Marian miracle stories” (McGuire 189-225, France 329). Interestingly, the monk is not only cured or aided, but also learns to be a great preacher through the milk,[27] and in one 13th-century source the holy fluid allowed the monk to obtain a “knowledge of letters.”[28] Here, the Virgin is regarded as a divine figure, not a mediatrix who intervenes on the male worshipper’s behalf to attain grace from the masculine divinity of the Father or the Son, and is able to also foster traditionally male knowledge of preaching and letters in the monk she blesses with her breast milk. This is certainly in line with the Cult of the Virgin popular through the Middle Ages and still arguably pursued in present-day Catholic tradition (especially in Latin America and the Philippines) which allowed for the persisted worship of the pre-Christian Earth Mother.[29] What is significant is that the Virgin, despite her status as mother and thus conscribed in a female body, still cultivates divine agency, which may be perceived to belong only to a masculine domain. The Virgin, having become pregnant and birthing a child miraculously, as well as being the only human after Christ’s death to have not suffered a bodily death,[30] reveals how the feminine can fit into the conception of the divine without becoming masculinized in some way. In her essay “Stabat Mater,” Julia Kristeva asks, “If it is not possible to say of a woman that she is..., would it perhaps be different concerning the mother, since that is the only function of the ‘other sex’ to which we can definitely attribute existence?” (161). If not knowing man sexually, as Eve did, somehow precludes her from some construct of the feminine, then the expression of motherhood with its pregnancy and bodily nourishment of the infant must call her back into that domain. 
That domain of motherhood, however, is not reserved for women. Christ is frequently a nurturer, who literally provides sustenance to his followers through his body and blood via transubstantiation during every Catholic mass. If one were to argue that corporeality and nourishing were exclusive to a feminine expression of spirituality, in Christ exists the clear exception. Caroline Walker Bynum discusses the parallelism between the Virgin’s breast and Christ’s wound, compellingly arguing the significance of the art historical record that positions Christ’s wound close to the breast is purposeful and telling.[31] Like Mary, too, and noted by Augustine, he is positioned as “Mediator of God and humanity, the man Jesus Christ,” existing simultaneously in the earthly and spiritual realms (1 Tim 2:5).[32] As the virgin son of God and woman, Christ is without a flesh and blood direct male ancestor, rendering him to be something of a gender outsider.[33] 
We must keep in mind that historically, blood has at times been gendered, as James White notes, “In medieval medical theory, blood was understood as the precursor to all other bodily fluids, including sperm and breast milk,” thus when Catherine equates the fragrance of her blood to that of Niccolò di Toldo,[34] she is suggesting that her blood is masculine rather than feminine (167). And for Christ, the opposite may well be true, as his human bloodlines are feminine, and as his blood is used in the production of a nourishing liquid. Catherine also constructs a “female Christ,” as F. Thomas Luongo has argued with regard to the language of Letter T273 that seems to reverse the traditional understanding of the Song of Songs, with Christ as the “sweet bride” who receives the masculine bridegroom soul in penetrative language (“Catherine of Siena: Rewriting the Female Holy Authority” 95-97).[35] Christ is in many ways tied to nourishing and motherhood and though he can be complicated as a feminine figure, he is still often cast as masculine and thus decidedly outside of the traditional realm inhabited by female. Roland Barthes suggests a new conception of the maternal: “Perhaps one should end up with this: ... no longer automatically confusing mother and woman. In which case, the androgyne would be any subject within whom there is something maternal” (194[v]). It is therefore necessary to claim the maternal as outside of woman, and fitting with a shifting, inconstant or outlying gender identification.
In Kristeva’s essay on the Virgin, she evokes not only milk but also tears as a non-verbal semiotics (174). While the milk is the symbol of nourishment, the mother’s tears are an expression of a sorrowful humanity; as a mother one is the symbol of life who also functions as the veil of inevitable death. However, again, it is not only women and mothers who cry — Abraham weeps out of mourning for Sarah in Genesis 23:2, David weeps occasionally in the Books of Samuel, Christ weeps in John 11:35 and Hebrews 5:7, Peter weeps bitterly after denying Christ in Matthew 26:75, Gregory the Great introduced the phrase “lacrymarum gratia” in his 6th-century Dialogues, sorrowful tears and the tears of his mother are a recurring motif in Augustine’s Confessions that factor into his conversion, tears were an important aspect of medieval monastic life for men,[36] and hagiographical records of Francis of Assisi note that his copious tears contributed to his eventually becoming blind. Arguably, each of these cases of tears are expressing sorrowful humanity, and are also spiritual utterances that are not constrained by corporeal states of sex, sexuality, or gender. The tears of men may not cause one to question their masculinity, but they do complicate the gendering of these emotional performances as ipso facto[w] feminine. Kristeva’s nonvocal semiotics of the mother can be extended to be part of a mystical semiotics that exist outside of speech and written word (as in Francis’s case), but should not be limited in its conscription to the domain of womanhood, as mothering and its expressions are not bound to a singular gender.
The figure of the virgin, who is determinedly outside of sexuality, and typically does not participate in the expression of motherhood as in Kristeva’s discussion of Mary, is even less easily gendered. For many, the virgin is in a privileged gender space, especially when the virgin is a woman. For many thinkers, the female virgin is so esteemed that she is rendered man. The Church Father, Jerome wrote, “long as women is for birth and children, she is as different from man as body is from soul. But when she wishes to serve Christ more than the world, then she will cease to be a woman and will be called man” (Bullough 227). Jerome utilizes the theological  dichotomy of body and soul to compare the state of woman and man, aligning women with a corporeal material state and men with a transcendent divine-reaching state. However, women who choose not to engage with what many of the pre-modern period would believe to be their biological destiny, can transcend their flesh-oriented state, and rather than produce more of humanity, can approach God. 
However, some Christian thinkers situate virginity as outside of a binary construction of gender. In an illustrated account of her mystical visions from the 12th century, the Scivias, Hildegard puts forth that married sexual life can be a fine choice for a Christian when done with care, but the corporeal state of virginity would always be preferable. Throughout her writing, she conflates “virginitas” with “viriditas” (greenness) and “virilitas” (virility) — for Hildegard and her contemporaries, words were valid signifiers for that which they signified. Thus, the virgin is a green and ripening fruit that pulls its power from the sun, rendering greenness to be a vital force that can be easily reconciled with the notion of virility. With these similarities in mind, both male and female “green” virgins prove to be not only virile, but the most virile of humans as virginity has more viridity (thus virility) integral to it than any other state of being. Indeed, in her Symphonia, Hildegard refers to the Virgin Mary as “viridissima virga” (no. 19) and Saint Rupert of Bingen as “dulcis viriditas pomis” (no. 49, 4a), while also emphasizing his position as a “vas nobile / quod non est pollutum” (no. 49, 4b). Though Maud Burnett McInerney argues that Hildegard represents Rupert through a “feminization of his body,” it seems to me that Hildegard is actually working to position the virgin within a separate class in and of itself (149). That is, the greenness that Hildegard describes is not in some way aligned with femininity, or even masculinity despite its connection to virility, but exists as an especially virile condition that is amplified for having been taken out of a sexual economy and gender. 
The figures of the mystic as well as the saint, whether virgin or not, are also in many ways beyond gender, just as they remain as individuals outside of the political life of society. Employing shifting subjectivity throughout her text Das fliessende Licht the beguine mystic Mechthild of Magdeburg has the allegorical Lady Knowledge instruct the soul: “You are a virile man in battle, a well-dressed virgin in the palace before your Lord, and a joyous bride in your bed with God”[37] (II.19). That is, the figure of the mystic is man, virgin and bride all at once — alternately courageous and pugnacious, courtly, ecstatic. With all of the recasting of gender in Song of Songs by religious thinkers, it is interesting to consider that in the Legenda aurea, Jacobus de Voragine describes Saint Sebastian as the saddle in between Christ-the-horseman and Church-the-horse. Though Sebastian has recently become an iconic saint for the LGBTQ community due to frequent homoerotic paintings of his martyrdom throughout art history,[38] Voragine was likely not consciously depicting Sebastian as inhabiting a third gender between the presumably masculine Christ and presumably feminine Church, though the imagery is decidedly sexual. Not only does Voragine evoke the Song of Songs,[39] but horseback riding as well, which was typically understood to be a metaphor for sexual relations throughout the medieval period.[40] In occupying the space between the masculine and the feminine, as the saddle between horse and rider, Sebastian can skillfully negotiate both spaces, or else be entirely outside either. Famously penetrated by all those arrows as one of his trials of martyrdom, Sebastian can occupy the positionality of the sexual female, while simultaneously holding military rank, which was traditionally reserved for the masculine domain. Though not described as a mystic, throughout his saintly life, Sebastian exemplifies the complicated gendering of the religious figure, which is even more problematized when the religious figure is also engaging with mysticism. 
Mystics in particular reject many of the traditional and typically masculine forms of Christian worship: the desert fathers and mothers rejected all societal and gendered context by separating themselves from it, cloistered and anchorite mystics separated themselves from society at large and the gender binary more specifically, and itinerant mystics like Catherine chose to live unconventional lives that were unattached to norms imposed by gender roles. As Bonaventure writes, the Franciscans prayed not on ecclesiastical books and did not chant the canonical hours, but prayed humbly to the Cross of Christ and on all things, suggesting that they were not interested in praying in a learned and erudite manner (which would have been limited to male Christians at the time) (IV, 3). Further, Bonaventure explains how the Franciscans believed that to achieve grace, one should renounce the wisdom of the world as well as his knowledge of letters, and thus dispossessed of such inheritance to go naked to the Lord (VII, 2). This teaching, which is certainly in keeping with Francis’s own biographical experience of renouncing his earthly possessions and law profession by rendering himself naked in a piazza of Assisi,[41] rings true for all mystics — without the accoutrements of clothing and societal performance, these figures are without gender, class or societal status, and are instead a homo sacer. 
Many mystics — more than denying themselves clothes, educational capital, belongings, and manneristic performance — tried to deny themselves of their body as well. Though Caroline Walker Bynum and Rudolph M. Bell discuss the many holy women who denied themselves food,[42] and the fasting Catherine would also limit her sleep to half an hour out of every period of two days, bodily denial was not limited to feminine spiritual practices. Hair shirts and flagellation were typical expressions of corporeal mortification and suffering across gender, whether to prevent sexual urges or in an attempt to no longer feel the body at all. In addition to sleeping on hard surfaces and a diet devoid of meat and cooked vegetables, in one hagiographic episode, Francis flees to the cold snow outside to dispel his desires. Writing on Spanish mystics including Juan de los Ángeles and John of the Cross, Maureen Flynn explains how negating the temporally-bound body proved to be a means to fully incorporate the soul more purely with God, allowing the individual’s core of the immortal soul to rid itself of sensory and mental faculties to transcend (“The Spiritual Uses of Pain in Spanish Mysticism”). This is to say, that even if we do not follow Judith Butler’s view that sex is just as much of a construction as gender is, these practices show that not only are mystics divorcing themselves from gender but they are trying to remove themselves from corporality: going naked to the Lord means ridding oneself not just of clothes but of the body as well. Mystics are working to exist on the Earth just as they eventually will in Paradise, as genderless, sexless, body-less immortal creatures of God. 
Although religious and holy figures engage with many of the same negotiations of sex, gender, and social status that mystics do, the mystic is in a special situation due to their direct access to God. As Helen Rolfson writes (128):
The mystic speaks of God as of the partner in dialogue. What is said about one is reflected mirror-wise in the other ... The prayers of Catherine of Siena beautifully demonstrate this reciprocity … As William of St. Thierry puts it: “True friendship either finds or creates equals.” No friendship is based on inequality. The mystic is very aware that that offer of divine friendship has been extended to one who is anything but God’s equal. 
Though mystics do not perceive themselves to be the equal to God, they see themselves to be a partner and a friend, which is a condition that approaches God unlike any other state of being. The unique relationship between mystic and God is often viewed as one in which the mystic serves as a conduit for God’s word, but, as Rolfson suggests, it proves to be more of a working and reciprocal partnership. And indeed, as Barbara Newman explains, often the mystic forgets the difference between the creature and the Creator, and “behaves as an equal” (144). Within this practice, the mystic’s conversations with God and the resulting writing that documents these dialogues act as another space in which the mystic serves to mediate. The mystic channels God’s direct teaching, filters it through her experience and knowledge, and then releases it as a means to teach and nurture others. The language, as we will explore, is bound by earthly literary conventions and reveals the agency that the mystic has in her relationship to God’s word. 
        More than a partnership, of course, is the union with God that all religious followers experience to some degree, but which mystics more palpably participate in, through mystical marriages and spiritual transpositions. Catherine of Siena marries Christ, exchanges her  corporeal heart with his, wears his foreskin for a ring,[43] relates how her name is interchanged with Christ’s by Niccolò di Toldo,[44] and carries out God’s work in public spaces throughout her life. She is not alone, as Catherine of Alexandria, Teresa of Àvila, Rose of Lima, Francisco de Hoyos y Sena[x], and many others also experienced a mystical wedding, and still more wrote prayers and sermons on marriage with Christ.[45] Similarly, others take the place of Christ in certain instances: the martyrs suffer and sacrifice themselves as Christ did, Bernard of Clairvaux drinks Mary’s milk in the place of the infant Jesus, Margaret and other saints literally and allegorically beat the devil as God does in the Bible. Origen adimantios writes on the role of the soul as a mother to Jesus “And every soul, virgin and uncorrupted, which conceives by the Holy Spirit, so as to give birth to the Will of the Father, is the Mother of Jesus,” emphasizing the constantly in-flux relationships between Mary and Christ, the soul and Mary, and the soul and Christ (Comm. on Mt. frg. 281 [GCS Origen 12.1:126.10-15]).[46] In remarking particularly of a pure soul, that is virginal and uncorrupted, Origen is limiting his pool of Christian followers dramatically, and speaks to the complicated role of the Virgin Mary, and the concept of the virgin as a figure that is on the peripheries of gender and in conflict with itself in many ways — at once a virgin and a mother. Moreover, Teresa of Ávila notes in her writing that she lived only through God being within her,[47] the missionary mystical writer Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza appropriates Christ’s voice, and Angela de Foligno identified with Christ throughout her writing (Cruz 133-136). In many ways the mystic is not only married with God, but entrenched with him, and more often with the Son of God specifically, exchanging body parts, voices, and positions with him. 
The union with God, whether it is perceived as the result of a mystical marriage or not, leads to another positionality that is difficult to locate. Jacopone da Todi writes of the union with God as a loss of self, tempering it paradoxically with some semblance of maintained subjectivity on the part of the soul who is both conquering and conquered: “The form that has been given you by God has absorbed you in such a way that you live although you are dead, both conqueror and conquered” (Laud 91, as quoted in The Flowering of Mysticism 130). Hadewijch[y] uses similar contradictory language of the union between the mortal soul and the divine in a letter (Letter IX)[48], 
From the depths of his wisdom, he shall teach you what he is and with what wonderful sweetness the one lover lives in the other and so permeates the other that they do not know themselves from each other. But they possess each other in mutual delight, mouth in mouth, heart in heart, body in body, soul in soul, while a single divine nature flows through them both and they both become one through each other, yet remaining always themselves.
In this description, there is a knowledge that is cultivated through the union — not a knowledge of letters (though one may gain that from Mary’s breast milk), but a certain sweet and spiritual wisdom. Hadewijch blends imagery from the Song of Songs with more equitable ideas about marriage than what may have been available at the time of her writing: two lovers who are one yet maintain their own identity. Quoting William of St. Thierry, Bernard McGinn writes, “The mystical life consists of an ongoing oscillation between [ ... ] two stages — ‘...the man of God ought to be always either rational in seeking or spiritual in loving’” (The Growth of Mysticism 235). The “man” of God is always finding himself in a fluctuating position, shifting between not just two stages of rationality (an earthly state) and spirituality, but constantly negotiating among many different registers that are coded as human, divine and other. Like the recluses of Siena in the 13th and 14th centuries, the mystic is on the peripheries of the city, at its edges like the homo sacer. 


“Let’s face it. We’re undone by each other. And if we’re not, we’re missing something. ...  One does not always stay intact. It may be that one wants to, or does, but it may also be that despite one’s best efforts, one is undone, in the face of the other, by the touch, by the scent, by the feel, by the prospect of the touch, by the memory of the feel. And so when we speak of my sexuality or my gender, as we do (and as we must) we mean something complicated by it. Neither of these is precisely a possession, but both are to be understood as modes of being dispossessed, ways of being for another, or indeed, by virtue of another.”

“That’s one of the things that “queer” can refer to: the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone’s gender, of anyone’s sexuality aren’t made (or can’t be made) to signify monolithically.

        The mystic is a borderless figure, gendered queer and an amalgamation between nature and divine, fluctuating between a this-worldly direction and an other-worldly focus. Like the Latin American figure of Santa Muerte, a skeleton saint who travels beyond borders with migrants who carry her and is considered to be at once folkloristic as well as holy, the mystics operate within a similar space: by being sacred they are othered. Nomadic, whether by being an earthly itinerant preacher or a divinely transcendent anchorite, the mystic passes through borders freely yet is bound by them, and persists as a figure of tension that holds “incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true,” paradoxically shifting between rational language and erotically charged spiritual language, the sense of being nothing and everything at once in union with, yet separate from God (Haraway 161). In her “Manifesto,” Donna Haraway writes, “Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment,” and, moreover, the queer cybernetic mystic might consider the partial, fluid, and sometimes-state of mortality and immortality, human and non-human (as they approach divinity), within and without (180). A paradoxical figure, the mystic, like the texts that she leaves behind, operates within the periphery: between and among, folklore and canon, erudite and wise yet uneducated and sensing.
Returning to Freud’s claim that “Mysticism is the obscure self-perception of the realm outside the ego, of the id,” and considering that the id also dominates psychological development prior to the phallic stage of sexual awareness and gender expression, it is possible to see how mystics are working outside of a sexual economy, outside of gender, and outside of typically human forms of consciousness. In her lyrical text, Teresa, My Love, on the mystic Teresa of Àvila, Kristeva really gets to the heart of the situation of the mystic (26):
Hail Teresa, borderless woman, … made word, made flesh, who unravels inside and outside herself, ... too much body yet disembodied, beyond matter, ... throbbing for the Beloved ever-present and yet never there, ... His in her, hers in Him, ... La Madre being the most virile of monks, most canny of the herders of souls, a veritable twin of Christ, she is He, He is she, the Truth is me, or Him in the deepest part of me, me Teresa…
The mystic is a conflation of so many seemingly contradictory yet in flux states of being. Despite these multivalent experiential states, there is an interest in self-construction among mystics that is beyond the constraints of society in general, and instead approaches a transcendent state of being that is yet still operating within temporal language and space. In this way, the mystic is within and without, straddling the border between the active and contemplative, the masculine and feminine, the earthly and the divine — and serving as a bridge that complicates these boundaries and fuses them together.

[1] In a literal sense this is very much the case, as Catherine had a mystical vision of Christ beckoning her from outside the door of her room, which led her to pursue public service.
[2] For a full discussion on this prayer, as well as the critical dissenters, see Noffke’s edition and translation, The Prayers of Catherine of Siena, 2nd edition, 2001, p. 50-55.
[3] “At all other times of the day — from getting up to go to the dining hall — she spends either devoting herself to, or teaching people, to follow God’s way; or in contemplation; and being in ecstasy as I said above; or reading holy books. But she spends the most time in contemplation if she is given leave to, because many people visit her out of devotion and want to see her to take example or teaching from her” (My translation).
[4] “You asked me if that verse of the Psalms: Domine non est exaltatum cor meum, should be sicut adlattatus without the b, or sicut ablattatus with the b” (my translation).
[5] “This letter and another I sent you I’ve written with my own hand on the Isola della Rocca, with so many sighs and tears that I couldn’t see even when I was seeing. But I was filled with wonder at myself and God’s goodness when I thought of his mercy toward me. He provided for my refreshment by giving me the ability to write — a consolation I’ve never known because of my ignorance — so that when I come down from the heights I might have a little something to vent my heart, lest it burst. Because he didn’t want to take me yet from this dark life, he fixed it in my mind in a marvelous manner, the way a teacher does when he gives his pupil a model. Shortly after you left me, I began to learn in my sleep, with the glorious evangelist John and Thomas Aquinas. Forgive me for writing so much, but my hands and my tongue run along with my heart. (Trans. Noffke, Letter T272, vol. II, 505-6). 
[6] See Noffke’s note 51 on page 505 of Volume II of her translation of Catherine’s letters for a discussion on the meaning of this passage. I agree with Noffke’s belief that “there is sufficient anecdotal evidence in the sources to indicate that Catherine did at this time in some fashion (miraculous or otherwise) learn to write in at least an elementary sort of way” (506).
[7] For analysis on Catherine’s heart, see Heather Webb’s article “Catherine of Siena’s Heart” (2005); and her book Medieval Heart (2010), p. 58-61 and p. 135-139 in particular.

[15] Brunetto Latini, Dante’s famous damned teacher, argues that Cicero’s teachings on speeches also apply to letters, suggesting to me that the oral production of writing is rhetorically sound. Latini’s French Tresor reinforces his notion that speaking is equivalent to letters:” Or dit li mastres que la escience de retorique est en .ii. mainieres, une qui est en dissant de boche & une autre que l’en mande par letres; mais li ensegnement sont comun, car il ne puet chaloir que l’en die ou en conte ou que l’en mande par letres…” (296).

[18] Although this should be taken with a grain of salt, and should not be considered to be fully comprehensive, Wikipedia provides a list of Christian mystics here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Christian_mystics 
[19] “Let nothing keep her from doing good with holy desire — whether it be diabolical temptation or carnal weakness ... Nor should her neighbors’ ingratitude or lack of recognition or appreciation keep her from serving them and seeking their salvation. If it did, it would seem that she was looking for some reward from them rather than from God, and she should prefer death to that!” (Trans. Noffke)
[20] “AlI want is love. In loving me you will realize love for your neighbors, and if you love your neighbors you have kept the Law. If you are bound by this love you will do everything you can to be of service wherever you are.” (Trans. Noffke)
[21] Catherine is not formally tried for witchcraft, but friends, family and her first confessor believed that her refusal to eat may have been the work of a demon. For more on this, see Rudolph Bell’s chapter, “I, Catherine” in his monograph Holy Anorexia, 1985. 
[22] As McGinn notes, “God lies beyond all distinctions of gender and the ordinary realms of consciousness (Flowering of Mysticism 169).
[23] This is divergent from Genesis 2.21-22, where Eve is constructed from the rib of Adam. Genesis 1.27 is closer to Genesis 5.1-2, though I contend that Genesis 5 is clearer in its meaning that both Adam and Eve are understood to be in God’s image, whereas Genesis 1 and 2 could be argued that Adam is created in God’s image while Eve may not be.
[24] “But I beg you, O Lord — if it is not too presumptuous of me — how can I, wretched and frail as I am, be of use to souls? My sex, as you know, is against it in many ways, both because it is not highly considered by men, and also because it is not good, for decency’s sake, for a woman to mix with men” (90).

For a discussion on the masculine nature of the bride, see Krahmer, Shawn M. “The Virile Bride of Bernard of Clairvaux.” Church History, Vol. 69, No. 2 (Jun., 2000), pp. 304-327.
[26] Ambrose similarly conflates the Bride with the image of the preacher, and refers to her/his breasts; see Expos. Ps. 118 6.18 (ed. Petschenig, p. 117.16-25). Additionally, Ambrose applies the imagery of the Song of Songs to specific individuals and events, including Emperor Valentinian II’s ascent into heaven (The Foundations of Mysticism 212).
[27] As McGuire notes this is in part owed to linguistic similarities: “the happy coincidence of the latin terms LAUDANS ET LACTANS” (200).

[30] Mary’s assumption into Heaven is not in Biblical text, but was written into doctrine by Pope Pius XII in 1950 (Munificentissimus Deus). In the Old Testament, two men are ambiguously described as being taken away by God rather than dying in a bodily way: Enoch (Genesis 5:24) and Elijah (2 Kings 2:11).

[39] Within the tradition of Christian allegory, with many commentaries written in the Middle Ages, the female protagonist of the Song of Songs is identified both as the Church (the collective people of God) and as the individual soul of the Christian who approaches Christ (constructed as the male bridegroom). For a full analysis of this tradition as well as how it differs from Jewish tradition, see Stephen D. Moore’s chapter on “The Song of Songs in the History of Sexuality” in his monograph God’s Beauty Parlor and Other Queer Spaces in and Around the Bible, 2001.
