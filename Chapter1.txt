Born in 1347 -- the twenty-third child of a wool-dyer father -- Caterina di Iacopo di Benincasa chose a religious life against her family’s wishes. At 6 years of age, she had her first mystical vision of Christ, at 7 she made a vow of perpetual virginity to God, and at 21, she married Christ in a vision during which she received a ruby ring  visible only to her. In the years leading to her mystical marriage, she diligently practiced asceticism, which Suzanne Noffke describes as “silent solitude” and “cozy isolationism” (65). In her youth and adolescence, Catherine was largely private, occupying a small room in her father’s house, while practicing daily flagellations and extreme fasting. Because of the severity of her actions, and their affects on her health, Raymond tells his readers that her family required her to keep her door ajar (V, 52). As she had decided early in life to dedicate herself to God, Catherine had initially followed a traditional approach typical of hermitage and cloistering of oneself, a popular form of spirituality through the Middle Ages. The 13th and 14th centuries found fertile ground for religious expression in the urban centers of Italy -- especially in Siena -- with male and particularly female recluses well supported by the city, and visible to society.[a] [something about why they declined - Although Catherine seemed content in her reclusive life, she was eventually compelled by God to lead a public life.]
While Catherine certainly spent her early years as an ascetic, her transition to communal space seems to have been grounded in her experiences. In her youth, she was attracted to the travelling Dominican preachers (Order of Friars Preachers) who came through Siena, and, as Raymond explicates, Catherine so esteemed these Dominican friars that she longed to enter their Order to help guide people in spiritual matters. However, Catherine realized that her status as a woman would prevent her from joining them, leading her to consider following Saint Euphrosyne’s model to pass herself as a man (III, 38). As Carolyn Muessig notes, Catherine would eventually prove to be an “itinerant peacemaker, papal representative of sorts, spiritual counselor, theologian, and tireless letter writer.”[b] And Raymond himself writes that “her life was to follow lines far different from those of other women,” as God sent her to live among people, working for others in public places (XII, 116). However, it was through communities of civic-minded and spiritual women that Catherine learned and flourished, and throughout her life she served as a community-builder and advocate to both secular and religious, regardless of gender. 
Catherine joined the Mantellate, a tertiary order of the Dominicans consisting of mostly widowed and married laywomen, when she was about 18 years old. The women at first did not want to accept her, as her status as a virgin was not typical of the order, but she was persistent and persuasive, as she would also prove to be in her subsequent political affairs. When Catherine first joined, she was still committed to prayer and solitude, but her work for the ill as a mantellata may have contributed in compelling her to leave her private space. The mantellate were dedicated to caring for the ill and doing good, and it was in hospitals that these group of women gathered, the center of which in Siena was the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala, near the Duomo. As Jane Tylus notes, the hospital “...represented an intermediary space between public and private ... for the layperson dedicated to acts of mercy” (68). Because of Siena’s location on the Via Francigena, the ancient pilgrimage route to Rome, the mantellate cared not only for their geographical neighbors but also for many visitors. Thus, Catherine’s position as a lay Dominican proved to be beneficial though her initial desire to be in the mantellate may have seemed contradictory. With this status, she had access to larger circles of people through her affiliation with the Dominicans and was able to engage with people of the world by living outside of a monastery, not unlike her Italian predecessor, Francis of Assisi.
In 1374, Catherine first travels to Florence, and she spends most of 1375 in Pisa, where she gained greater public status. While she had started constructing herself as a public figure in Siena, she generated excitement during her extended stay in Pisa and established herself as a public preacher and miracle worker (Capecelatro 107, Tylus 134). It is from Pisa that Catherine begins to engage in intense and frequent letter-writing, often addressing her spiritual and blood famiglia in Siena. In 1376 she travels to Avignon and is credited with the pope’s return to Rome in September of that year, proving herself as someone engaged in politics. Still, as a woman in the public sphere, she was accused of vainglory, which Raymond sought to defend throughout the last chapter of his Legenda. As one may expect, this is a gendered issue, as Raymond notes her critics claimed, “‘She’s a woman. Why doesn’t she stay in her cell, if it’s God she wants to serve’?” (IV, 365). Raymond writes that both men and women are accusatory, and he uses examples from her fellow mantellate, instead proving her sanctity by describing her steadfastness and commitment to the public work of God. In this manner, Raymond is quick to disband Catherine from the urban communities that she is actively involved with, asserting her as a solitary holy figure. 
However, according to the anonymously authored Miracoli di Caterina di Iacopo da Siena, Catherine read aloud to her fellow Mantellate at supper time, which Tylus notes “situates Catherine in a world of women who, far from spreading snide words about her imagined sanctity, are listening to her read...” (127). Meanwhile, Raymond’s own Legenda major, Caffarini’s Leggenda minore and Processo Castellano, Stefano Maconi’s and the Pope’s letters -- to name a few -- are all indicative of Catherine’s participation not just in a female community but an active interlocutor of the male religious community as well. Her letters on practical matters (to a prostitute, different classes [...])[c], political leaders ( [d]) and concerning the justice system ([that letter about the execution[e]]) reveal her participation in wider civic society. Therefore, Catherine of Siena is not a mystic bound by her interiority and other-worldliness, but rather an active force in this world -- her contemporary Italy -- and a remarkable human who can operate outside and within gender and society. 
In this chapter, I will explore the special situation of the mystic, Catherine’s own self-construction through her words and through her work, and her construction by others to lead to her canonization in 1461.


Theory






Because of Catherine’s letters, we have more than these echoes of past involvement in a community of women. Of her letters that survive, one-third of them were written to women, proving the significance of her relationships with women, as well as her esteem of them, as she chooses to not only address the pope, political leaders and her confessors in her letters, but the women belonging to her order as well as those from different classes. The female community she belonged to were also significant in the propagation of her letters, as they were her first scribes. The dispersal of Catherine’s letters therefore establishes a group of women capable of reading and writing in the vernacular — not considered to be literacy in a Latinate world, but still revealing of the education attained by these individuals.
