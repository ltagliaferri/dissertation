Born in 1347 -- the twenty-third child of a wool-dyer father -- Caterina di Iacopo di Benincasa chose a religious life against her family’s wishes. At 6 years of age, she had her first mystical vision of Christ, at 7 she made a vow of perpetual virginity to God, and at 21, she married Christ in a vision during which she received a ruby ring  visible only to her. In the years leading to her mystical marriage, she diligently practiced asceticism, which Suzanne Noffke describes as “silent solitude” and “cozy isolationism” (65). In her youth and adolescence, Catherine was largely private, occupying a small room in her father’s house, while practicing daily flagellations and extreme fasting. Because of the severity of her actions, and their affects on her health, Raymond tells his readers that her family required her to keep her door ajar (V, 52). As she had decided early in life to dedicate herself to God, Catherine had initially followed a traditional approach typical of hermitage and cloistering of oneself, a popular form of spirituality through the Middle Ages. The 13th and 14th centuries found fertile ground for religious expression in the urban centers of Italy -- especially in Siena -- with male and particularly female recluses well supported by the city, and visible to society.[a] [something about why they declined - Although Catherine seemed content in her reclusive life, she was eventually compelled by God to lead a public life.]
While Catherine certainly spent her early years as an ascetic, her transition to communal space seems to have been grounded in her experiences. In her youth, she was attracted to the travelling Dominican preachers (Order of Friars Preachers) who came through Siena, and, as Raymond explicates, Catherine so esteemed these Dominican friars that she longed to enter their Order to help guide people in spiritual matters. However, Catherine realized that her status as a woman would prevent her from joining them, leading her to consider following Saint Euphrosyne’s model to pass herself as a man (III, 38). As Carolyn Muessig notes, Catherine would eventually prove to be an “itinerant peacemaker, papal representative of sorts, spiritual counselor, theologian, and tireless letter writer.”[b] And Raymond himself writes that “her life was to follow lines far different from those of other women,” as God sent her to live among people, working for others in public places (XII, 116). However, it was through communities of civic-minded and spiritual women that Catherine learned and flourished, and throughout her life she served as a community-builder and advocate to both secular and religious, regardless of gender. 
Catherine joined the Mantellate, a tertiary order of the Dominicans consisting of mostly widowed and married laywomen, when she was about 18 years old. The women at first did not want to accept her, as her status as a virgin was not typical of the order, but she was persistent and persuasive, as she would also prove to be in her subsequent political affairs. When Catherine first joined, she was still committed to prayer and solitude, but her work for the ill as a mantellata may have contributed in compelling her to leave her private space. The mantellate were dedicated to caring for the ill and doing good, and it was in hospitals that these group of women gathered, the center of which in Siena was the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala, near the Duomo. As Jane Tylus notes, the hospital “...represented an intermediary space between public and private ... for the layperson dedicated to acts of mercy” (68). Because of Siena’s location on the Via Francigena, the ancient pilgrimage route to Rome, the mantellate cared not only for their geographical neighbors but also for many visitors. Thus, Catherine’s position as a lay Dominican proved to be beneficial though her initial desire to be in the mantellate may have seemed contradictory. With this status, she had access to larger circles of people through her affiliation with the Dominicans and was able to engage with people of the world by living outside of a monastery, not unlike her Italian predecessor, Francis of Assisi.
In 1374, Catherine first travels to Florence, and she spends most of 1375 in Pisa, where she gained greater public status. While she had started constructing herself as a public figure in Siena, she generated excitement during her extended stay in Pisa and established herself as a public preacher and miracle worker (Capecelatro 107, Tylus 134). It is from Pisa that Catherine begins to engage in intense and frequent letter-writing, often addressing her spiritual and blood famiglia in Siena. In 1376 she travels to Avignon and is credited with the pope’s return to Rome in September of that year, proving herself as someone engaged in politics. Still, as a woman in the public sphere, she was accused of vainglory, which Raymond sought to defend throughout the last chapter of his Legenda. As one may expect, this is a gendered issue, as Raymond notes her critics claimed, “‘She’s a woman. Why doesn’t she stay in her cell, if it’s God she wants to serve’?” (IV, 365). Raymond writes that both men and women are accusatory, and he uses examples from her fellow mantellate, instead proving her sanctity by describing her steadfastness and commitment to the public work of God. In this manner, Raymond is quick to disband Catherine from the urban communities that she is actively involved with, asserting her as a solitary holy figure. 
However, according to the anonymously authored Miracoli di Caterina di Iacopo da Siena, Catherine read aloud to her fellow Mantellate at supper time, which Tylus notes “situates Catherine in a world of women who, far from spreading snide words about her imagined sanctity, are listening to her read...” (127). Meanwhile, Raymond’s own Legenda major, Caffarini’s Leggenda minore and Processo Castellano, Stefano Maconi’s and the Pope’s letters -- to name a few -- are all indicative of Catherine’s participation not just in a female community but an active interlocutor of the male religious community as well. Her letters on practical matters (to a prostitute, different classes [...])[c], political leaders ( [d]) and concerning the justice system ([that letter about the execution[e]]) reveal her participation in wider civic society. Therefore, Catherine of Siena is not a mystic bound by her interiority and other-worldliness, but rather an active force in this world -- her contemporary Italy -- and a remarkable human who can operate outside and within gender and society. 
In this chapter, I will explore the special situation of the mystic, Catherine’s own self-construction through her words and through her work, and her construction by others to lead to her canonization in 1461.


Try to start with an overarching quote “the mystic is…”
Theoretical thoughts about mysticism counter to some real mystical lives and the words of the mystics
        In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir characterizes the mystic as a lover desirous of [f]Christ, associated with blood and self-annihilation, and ostensibly a woman. As part of Beauvoir’s argument throughout the broader text, love is assigned to woman as her supreme vocation -- that is, she is defined by the loving she does. When a woman loves a man, Beauvoir explains, she is seeking God in this man. Man is the representation of God (or the logos), and as Lacan further demonstrates, “The phallus is the signifier of signifiers, the privileged signifier of that mark in which the role of the logos is joined with the advent of desire[g][h].” For man, reason and desire and the logos are conflated, but as woman is without the phallus, she is relegated to the lover, only capable of desiring the logos, typically in the form of a man. If, Beauvoir writes, human love is denied to her -- whether due to her having been disappointed in love, or her having been too selective in choosing a lover -- she may seek the logos in the person of God himself. Interestingly, by choosing to direct herself to God, the female mystic is superseding the intermediary force of the male human and is encountering the logos unimpeded, desiring this true signifier of signifiers rather than the corporeal representation of God found in man. The female mystic using love (even desirous love) as a vehicle toward desiring and comprehending the logos is exactly in line with Christian theology, as Dante[i][j][k] so aptly illustrates in erotic language throughout Paradiso[l] by borrowing from the similar eroticism inherent in the biblical Song of Songs and hagiographies (e.g., St. Francis marrying Poverty). The blending of caritas and eros as a method for approaching the divine and thus the logos or God is a legitimate expression of faith that simultaneously disrupts psychoanalytic gendering of women through their channeling of desirous love to encounter the logos unmediated by masculine accoutrements.
Much of the tension surrounding the mystic in theoretical inquiry pivots around the perception of the mystic as an hysterical figure. Hélène Cixous views mystics to be aligned with hysteria rather than religiosity -- a religious woman, for Cixous, is an obsessive-compulsive, whereas an hysterical woman is an artist and revolutionary. In general, and as Amy Hollywood notes, theorists typically denigrate the affective and expressive embodiments of mysticism, though the rare exceptions (Bataille, Beauvoir, Lacan, Irigaray) view these women less pathologically and instead as subversive figures who can effectively merge action and contemplation, emotion and reason, body and soul. Teresa of Avila and Angela of Foligno are discussed in particular, and Beauvoir writes on Joan of Arc and Catherine of Siena as well. In Catherine’s texts, she adroitly blends the active with the contemplative, doing good works in the world as part of her spirituality.

        Beauvoir’s treatment of the mystic is limited to a Western and Christian inquiry, and contends that the role of the mystic is primarily played by women rather than men. Though there are actually many more male mystics than female mystics[m][n][o], this false claim suggests that mysticism may be read to be a more feminine pursuit in the 20th century, though historically it would have been viewed as a more masculine vocation. Indeed, Margaret King notes that between 1300 and 1700 “witches” outnumbered religious women 100 to 1, revealing that women who attempted to be viewed as religious were much more frequently viewed to be demonic[p], an accusation Catherine herself had endured. In acceding that some mystics are men, Beauvoir explains, “Male mystics are rare and their fervor is highly refined and intellectual[q][r].” Suggesting, evidently, that female mystics are somehow less refined and less intellectual in their devotion. Still, 
and other feminist theorists, tend to conflate mysticism with femininity?




Action & the Mystic in Beauvoir: Ecstasies, visions, talks with God, relationship between contemplation and action
         * Women of action who know very well what goals they have in mind and lucidly devise means for attaining them; their visions simply provide objective images for their certitudes, encouraging these women to persist in the paths they have mapped out in detail for themselves
            * St Catherine
            * St Teresa
            * Joan of Arc
         * Narcissistic women -- silent fervor → apostolic state, they do something
      * Mystical fervor, like love and even narcissism, can be integrated with a life of activity and independence
         * But in themselves, bound to meet with failure
         * She is either putting herself into relation with an unreality: her double, or God; or she creates an unreal relation with a real being
            * In both cases, she lacks any grasp on the world; she does not escape her subjectivity; her liberty remains frustrated


        Indeed, Dante refers to the angels as “amatori” much like how Catherine refers to herself and other religious people who seek divine truth through erotic language. 
This is all coming from the same tradition!
        


Chapter 1 will consist of three sections, beginning with a theoretical grounding utilizing gender theory to describe the situation of the mystic and how mystics have negotiated agency through their relative position outside of or traversing both gender binaries and earthly-spiritual binaries in their visionary writing. In this section I will explore the mystical transgression of heteronormative roles through theoretical texts that will support the identifying and analyzing of the subject position problematizing done by religious writers and Catherine of Siena in particular. Among the theorists who will inform this inquiry are Kristeva (“Stabat Mater”), Butler (Gender Trouble), Sedgwick (Epistemology of the Closet), Harraway (“Cyborg Manifesto”) and Braidotti (Nomadic Subjects, The Posthuman), as their texts will establish the mystic as a figure contextualized as queer, nomadic and cybernetic (an amalgamation between nature and divine).


Because of Catherine’s letters, we have more than these echoes of past involvement in a community of women. Of her letters that survive, one-third of them were written to women, proving the significance of her relationships with women, as well as her esteem of them, as she chooses to not only address the pope, political leaders and her confessors in her letters, but the women belonging to her order as well as those from different classes. The female community she belonged to were also significant in the propagation of her letters, as they were her first scribes. The dispersal of Catherine’s letters therefore establishes a group of women capable of reading and writing in the vernacular — not considered to be literacy in a Latinate world, but still revealing of the education attained by these individuals.
