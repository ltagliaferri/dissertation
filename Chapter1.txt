Lyrical Mysticism: The Writing and Reception of Catherine of Siena
Chapter I: The Figure of the Mystic
Catherine of Siena, as a writer and reader, student and teacher outside of traditional and established elite hierarchies, proves herself to be a liminal figure, pushing against conventional norms while also capable of moving through and working within prescribed systems. Her success as a writer, as a religious figure, and as a saint, depended very much on her ability to construct herself in ways that were within and without acceptable boundaries for what a 14th-century Italian woman were. In many ways, her robust efforts at community building served her well throughout her life and continued to serve her in the construction of her legacy. But another aspect of her life also clearly guided her spirituality as well as her approach to writing and even her community development: mysticism. Understanding Catherine as a mystic is crucial for contextualizing the reasons why she engaged in so much outreach, and how writing fit into her religiosity and social justice-driven approach to faith. This chapter is devoted to the figure of the mystic: how the mystic is theoretically cast as a transgressive figure at the borders of binaries but also outside of them. Thinking about Catherine in these terms will enable us to move forward with her writing from the theoretically grounded perspective that she is functioning at the margins of male and female, human and divine, sanctioned and unsanctioned.
A year before his death, Sigmund Freud writes a single sentence in an entry dated August 22, 1938: “Mysticism is the obscure self-perception of the realm outside the ego, of the id” (“Mystik de dunkle Selbstwahrehmung des Reiches ausserhalb des Ichs, des Es”). Though Freud wrote on mysticism throughout his life, he did not view it as a means to religious redemption, but seemed to couple it more with psychoanalysis itself, as a way to know that which exists outside of the ego, in direct contact with the id.[1] In general, Freud sees mysticism as irrational and in lack of an organizing language, while still probing at an intellectual problem that cannot be grasped by the rational self. Though many theorists will agree with its irrationality and further identify the mystic as a pathological figure, others view mysticism to be a domain within which a specific language is explored and brought to light, beyond the boundaries of learned and self-conscious speech and writing. For feminist theorists, the language is largely charged with amorous expression due to mysticism being intrinsically joined with femininity and a state of loving and even eroticism. 
        In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir characterizes the mystic as a lover desirous of Christ, associated with blood and self-annihilation, and ostensibly a woman. As part of Beauvoir’s argument throughout the broader text, love is assigned to woman as her supreme vocation — that is, she is defined by the loving she does. When a woman loves a man, Beauvoir explains, she is seeking God in this man. Man is the representation of God (or the logos), and as Lacan further demonstrates, “The phallus is the signifier of signifiers, the privileged signifier of that mark in which the role of the logos is joined with the advent of desire” (Écrits 287). For man, reason and desire and the logos are conflated, but as woman is without the phallus, she is relegated to the lover, only capable of desiring the logos, typically in the form of a man. If, Beauvoir writes, human love is denied to her — whether due to her having been disappointed in love, or her having been too selective in choosing a lover — she may seek the logos in the person of God himself. Interestingly, by choosing to direct herself to God, the female mystic is superseding the intermediary force of the male human and is encountering the logos unimpeded, desiring this true signifier of signifiers rather than the corporeal representation of God found in man. The female mystic using love (even desirous love) as a vehicle toward desiring and comprehending the logos is exactly in line with Christian theology, as Dante so aptly illustrates in erotic language throughout Paradiso by borrowing from the eroticism inherent in the biblical Song of Songs and hagiographies (e.g., St. Francis marrying Poverty).[2] The blending of caritas and eros as a method for approaching the divine and thus the logos or God is a legitimate expression of faith that simultaneously disrupts psychoanalytic gendering of women through their channeling of desirous love to encounter the logos unmediated by masculine accoutrements.
Much of the tension surrounding the mystic in theoretical inquiry pivots around the perception of the mystic as an hysterical figure. Hélène Cixous views the mystic as being aligned with hysteria rather than religiosity — a non-mystical religious woman, for Cixous, is an obsessive-compulsive, whereas an hysterical woman is an artist and revolutionary. In my reading, and as Amy Hollywood notes in general terms, theorists typically denigrate the affective and expressive embodiments of mysticism, though the rare exceptions (Bataille, Beauvoir, Lacan, Irigaray) view these women less pathologically and instead as subversive figures who can effectively merge action and contemplation, emotion and reason, body and soul. Teresa of Avila and Angela of Foligno are discussed in particular throughout theoretical writing on mysticism, and Simone de Beauvoir specifically writes on Joan of Arc and Catherine of Siena as well. 
On Catherine of Siena, Beauvoir in fact mentions her prior to discussing the mystic in particular, when she addresses the special status of queens and saints, who, she argues, were afforded more social support than other women and granted equality. Women she mentions in this regard include Clotilda, Radegonde, Blanche of Castile, Heloise, Joan of Arc, along with Catherine (104). As an Italian woman, Catherine is mentioned again when Beauvoir discusses how women made gains during the Italian Renaissance; she argues that there is individualism available for everyone regardless of sex, and that women became powerful sovereigns, military leaders, artists, writers and musicians (105). When she writes on the mystic in chapter 24 (670-678), in which she mentions Catherine on several occasions, she discusses how the mystic tries to annihilate herself, while also being especially concerned with blood, setting up an interesting mystical obsession with corporeality that is both a denial and a preoccupation with bodily fluid. For mystics, “Ecstasy mimics corporeally that abolition of the ego;” that is, whereas other loving women may abolish only their psychological egos, mystics also annihilate their flesh (675). 
However, they are also especially concerned with blood, which Beauvoir claims is part of indulging in “sado-masochistic fantasies,” and mentions that “St Catherine of Siena refers to [Christ’s blood] in most of her letters” (676, 677). Of course, Catherine evokes the blood of Christ within the rhetorical structure of her letters. As a liminal figure between the Middle Ages and the early modern period, Catherine is very much engaging with a form of medieval devotion that is concerned with Christ’s blood, and referring to this as sadomasochistic is certainly an anachronistic reading. What is more unsubstantiated about Beauvoir’s analysis on the mystic is that she writes, “To be sure, there have also been men who burned with that flame, but they are rare and their fervor is of a highly refined intellectual cast, whereas the women who abandon themselves to the joys of the heavenly nuptials are legion, and their experience is of a peculiarly emotional nature” (670). I say this is unsubstantiated, because not only does it incorrectly estimate the number of male mystics (there are many more male mystics than female mystics)[3], but also because it sets up a false dichotomy of mystical expression. What is not intellectual about Hildegard and Catherine? What is not emotional about Bernard of Clairvaux and Francis of Assisi?
Where Beauvoir’s examination is rich and vital is when she discusses the relationship between action and contemplation, which is what gets at the heart of Catherine’s mysticism. Beauvoir maintains that for some women, “Ecstasies, visions, talks with God — this inner experience is enough,” but that “[o]thers feel impelled to transmit it to the world through acts” (677). She further explains that these are “women of action [. . .] who know very well what goals they have in mind and who lucidly devise means for attaining them: their visions simply provide objective images for their certitudes” (678). For Beauvoir, Teresa of Àvila is the preeminent embodiment of this mystical sensibility, but she includes Catherine of Siena and Joan of Arc among the women who use contemplation to fuel their action in the world. What is significant here is that there is a balance and an occupation of a liminal space between contemplation and action. Where many religious figures are revered for their meditative approach to spirituality, mystics are typically engaging with the wider world in some way, to transmit their knowledge through text, or to be involved in doing charitable and political works for wider social good.
As Beauvoir does dwell on Catherine of Siena in her text, it is worthwhile to quote her assessment of the mystic at length (104):
the story of St Catherine of Siena is significant; in the midst of a quite normal existence she created in Siena a great reputation by her active benevolence and by the visions that testified to her intense inner life; thus she acquired the authority necessary for success, which women usually lack. Appeal was made to her influence in exhorting those condemned to death, in bringing back wanderers, and in allaying quarrels between families and cities. She had the support of a society that recognized itself in her, and thus it was that she could fulfill her mission of pacification, preaching from city to city submission to the Pope, keeping up extensive correspondence with bishops and rulers, and in the end being chosen by Florence as ambassadress to go to seek out the Pope in Avignon.[4]
Catherine’s “active charité” is juxtaposed with her “visions qui manifestent son intense vie intérieure,” but rather than occupying two different aspects of Catherine’s approach to life, they support and drive each other (169). As a person inciting works of charity and spiritual policy, Catherine was an inherent element of her community, and she reflected back the community she was a part of and helped to maintain (“Elle est soutenue par la collectivité qui se reconnaît en elle” (169)). As Beauvoir sees Catherine, the active life and the contemplative life are impossible to disentangle, and serve as the foundation of Catherine’s mysticism.
        Catherine’s own texts adroitly blend the active with the contemplative, emphasizing her act of doing good works in the world as part of her spirituality. In a letter to the Dominican abbess and nuns of San Pietro in Monticelli a Lignaia in Florence, she writes (T79):
E non lassi la buona operazione con santi desiderii, nè per tentazione del dimonio, nè per fragilità della carne … E non debbe lassare il servire al prossimo suo, nè di cercare la salute sua, per ingratitudine nè per ignoranzia, che non cognoscesse il servizio. Non debbe lassare; perocchè, se lassasse, parrebbe che cercasse d’essere retribuito da loro, e non da Dio: la quale cosa non si debbe fare, ma prima eleggere la morte.[5]
For Catherine, doing good is intrinsically tied to holy desire, and nothing should prevent the servants of God from serving their neighbors, whether it is corporeal weakness or their neighbors’ ingratitude. She emphasizes that their fellow earth-bound humans cannot offer them a reward, so they should not seek one from them but from God through eternal life. This letter, which Suzanne Noffke dates to October 1377, is contemporaneous with Catherine’s writing of the Dialogo, and this sentiment of loving thy neighbor through service is reiterated in a statement of God’s in Dialogo 7:
come io non voglia altro che amore, poiché l’uomo esercita l’amore del prossimo nell’amore di me. Quando ha adempiuto il precetto dell’amore del prossimo, egli ha osservato la legge, e coi legami di questa dilezione, potendo, farà utlità agli altri secondo il proprio stato.[6]
Being useful to others is the proper state for followers of God, for when people love each other they are showing love for their creator, and upholding his law. This service or active charity is such a crucial component of Catherine’s mysticism and general mode of living in the world, that she includes it in her advice letters directly to others as well as early on in her Dialogo which is intended for all to read and learn from.
        As Catherine was working on this merging of the active life with the contemplative life in her own daily activities, there is a contemporaneous shift in Renaissance hagiography from an other-worldly spirituality to a this-worldly spirituality. Alison Knowles Frazier discusses this movement in her work, Possible Lives: Authors and Saints in Renaissance Italy, which is focused on representations of men living the vita activa alongside reform of religious life that generally moved men outside of communal cloisters and into city centers. Figures like St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Ambrose, St. Potitus and St. Nicholas are profiled in particular, and the Latin humanist writers generally prefer the male subject to the female, with only about 5% of Dominican accounts and 25% of Franciscan accounts being about women (Frazier 35). The manifestation of this preference in hagiographies of Catherine’s time reveals that this is an increasingly condoned modus operandi of religious expression, though the fact that it was almost entirely limited to male religious hagiographies shows that blending of action with contemplation was not typical or sanctioned for female religious figures like Catherine.
In fact, many women in the medieval and early modern periods would have been entirely precluded from having a this-worldly active life whether religious or not. Aristotle develops the crucial distinctions between zoe and bios, oikos and polis, limiting women to the realms of zoe (the biological life outside of politics) and oikos (the home), whereas men inhabit the domains of bios (the qualified life, the life of society, and political life) and polis (the city). Though there are some women who were able to engage in their local public contexts — like Mary Magdalene, Joan of Arc (until she was captured by England), Eleanor of Aquitaine, Vittoria Colonna — the vast majority of women from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance were unable to participate in the political life of the city, including those who claimed to have a higher divine impetus for doing so. In Women of the Renaissance, Margaret King notes that between the years of 1300 and 1700 “witches” in Italy outnumbered religious women 100 to 1, revealing that women who attempted to be viewed as religious and spread the word about their sanctity were much more frequently viewed to be demonic, an accusation that Catherine herself had even endured from some skeptics (described by Raymond as her “disparagers” (176-7)), though she is distinguished as a Church Doctor today (145).[7] Even earlier female mystics like Hildegard of Bingen (who did have the support of Bernard of Clairvaux) led remarkable lives pursuing multivalent approaches to knowledge production and creative works, yet were proscribed from a public life outside the cloister apart from their letter writing endeavors. Though letter writing could be interpreted to be a subversive form of political engagement, and would continue to be an important method of communication for later mystics and Catherine of Siena in particular, there is still a lack of public presence and public voice. Famously, a portion of Hildegard’s Scivias was read aloud by Pope Eugenius III to assembled clergy, revealing how even a medieval woman’s writing could participate in public performance, though the female voice of the writer is left unheard (Logan 175). Catherine stepping outside of a designated role as female religious puts her in a vacillating space, not just between contemplative life and active life, but also between male and female expression.
Like Beauvoir’s description of the woman intellectual, the mystic or even religious woman is othered twice: first she is an outsider contained within zoe, secondly she is an outsider for being something that is “sacred.” In Roman law, the homo sacer is one who cannot be sacrificed yet can be killed without the killer being condemned for homicide — those that are sacred belonging to the class of those who exist outside of society (Agamben 47). Priests, hermits, the sacrificial and the gods all exist outside of bios, outside of society and in a state of exclusion. Yet, all except God(s) are in some ways included in the form of exclusion — what Agamben describes as “the ambiguity of the sacred” — these sacred men are in some ways within and some ways without (50). Ambiguity consistently lies within the construction of the sacred, with overlapping between the holy and the unclean, for instance, which is an even more historically difficult line for women to negotiate. This is because the femina sacra, doubly without political life, is rendered twice removed. The “witches” killed throughout history for being part of this femina sacra classification suffered due to their twice-othered status, yet without any ramifications for those who killed them — in most cases the state. Though very few feminae sacrae were fortunate enough to escape death by the state successfully, this may have been due to their amplified outsider status. A sacred woman existed completely outside the world of man, just like God,[8] and was therefore closer to the word of God, viewed more often as a conduit for God’s word in their mystical writing, than as a mediatrix channeling the logos.
As men were typically able to express their religious authority through learning, citation, rhetoric, and public engagement, they were not limited to the “prophetic, visionary, or mystical claims [that] were the primary modes of religious authorization available to women” (Hollywood, “Gender, Agency” 514). On the figure of the male mystic, Lacan writes, “There are men who are just as good as women. It does happen. Despite, I won’t say their phallus, despite what encumbers them on that score, they get the idea, they sense there must be a jouissance which goes beyond. That is what we call a mystic” (“God and the Jouissance” 147 / S XX p. 76). Here, Lacan ties mysticism to bodily experience that is a painful pleasure (for him, beyond the phallus), an eroticism that could be said to be described frequently in mystical writing. Though corporeality and perceived sexual difference are subjects touched upon by mystics, along with images of sensually felt divine love, there is also at play a complication of gender throughout many mystical and religious texts that suggests that there is an aspect of mysticism that goes beyond not just jouissance but also beyond a dichotomous gender binary. As Anne J. Cruz writes, “female mystics verbalize a uniquely Christocentric position that both transgresses and transcends gender order,” and I would add this to mystics in general, not just that male mystics participate in jouissance, but are equally inhabiting a complicated space that is both pushing at the boundaries and beyond the construction of gender (134).
Running parallel yet divergent to the other creation stories of Genesis,[9] the book of the generations of Adam, Genesis 5, reads, “In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created” (1-2). That is, from the beginning, male and female are part of Adam, and are also, presumably, part of God, as Adam is created in God’s image. This rings remarkably similar to Aristophanes’s creation tale of the three sexes as described in Plato’s Symposium, except that in Genesis 5 there is only one sex comprised of both male and female identity (189e-194e). Perhaps, like the four-legged androgyne of Aristophanes, the female part of Adam was excised to form Eve, and we have since inherited a double-sexed notion of gender which was largely enforced in the Middle Ages and early modern period. Yet, from these early religious texts, there is enough scope for two genders to exist in one body, suggesting a complication of gender from the very creation stories that propagate the Judeo-Christian tradition. Raymond reports that, when Catherine spoke to God about her misgivings of being female,[10] God replied (90):
Am not I He who created the human race, and divided it into male and female? I spread abroad the grace of my spirit where I will. In my eyes there is neither male nor female, rich nor poor, but all are equal, for I can do all things with equal ease.
Though Raymond’s description of God’s words are somewhat contradictory, this statement is in line with Genesis 5. Even if God divided humanity across male and female gendered lines, he indicates that he does not see them as separate or unequal beings, nor does he judge humans based on their economic status.
From a linguistic perspective, the situation of the soul is decidedly feminine as the Latin word “anima” is a feminine word. Thus, mystical writers like Jerome, Gregory of Nyssa, Thomas Aquinas (in Summa theologica as well as De anima), and Bernard of Clairvaux view the soul as intrinsically feminine. For those writing in the vernacular, Meister Eckhart uses the German feminine noun “Seele,” and Catherine of Siena and Teresa of Avila will adopt the feminine “a/ánima” in their native Italian and Spanish, respectively. Though linguistic gender may not seem particularly remarkable, it is worth noting that male religious writers and mystics sometimes speak of the self in feminine terms, perhaps informed by the gendered language in addition to the hierarchical position of the worshipper who approaches the divine (Harmless 49, 85). Iacopone da Todi positions the reader in the position of the donna to the lord God, regardless of whether the readers of his Italian laude were male or female. In Laude 91 he writes “tu sè donna & signore”[11] as he discusses the union between God and Christian that causes multivalent subjectivity (the soul is both possessed and possessing, is both drinking and is drunk), and is infused with erotic and marital imagery. Bernard of Clairvaux speaks of himself and his fellow monks as feminine throughout his writing. His Sermons on the Song of Songs speak to the malleability of the reader’s gender, as the presumably male reader must place himself in the position of the presumably feminine bride — allegorically the Church — to the presumably masculine bridegroom of Christ.[12] In this text, he describes being kissed on the mouth by Christ, and remarks on his female corporeality including breasts that swell with milk (2.2, 9.2, 9.7).[13] 
Famously, Bernard is also tied to breast milk due to his mystical vision known as Lactatio Bernardi in which the Virgin Mary intervenes on his behalf, perhaps to cure an eye infection, by either shooting her milk into his eyes, or dripping it into his mouth. In his chapter on “Bernard and Mary’s Milk,” Brian Patrick McGuire details a number of stories and visual art treatments that center around Bernard or another unnamed monk from Clairvaux, and James France notes that Bernard was not the only non-Christ figure suckling Mary’s milk as this became a “widespread theme in collections of Marian miracle stories” (McGuire 189-225, France 329). Interestingly, the monk is not only cured or aided, but also learns to be a great preacher through the milk,[14] and in one 13th-century source the holy fluid allowed the monk to obtain a “knowledge of letters.”[15] Here, the Virgin is regarded as a divine figure, not a mediatrix who intervenes on the male worshipper’s behalf to attain grace from the masculine divinity of the Father or the Son, and is able to also foster traditionally male knowledge of preaching and letters in the monk she blesses with her breast milk. This is certainly in line with the Cult of the Virgin popular through the Middle Ages and still arguably pursued in present-day Catholic tradition (especially in Latin America and the Philippines) which allowed for the persistent worship of the pre-Christian Earth Mother.[16] What is significant is that the Virgin, despite her status as mother and thus embodied as female, still cultivates divine agency, which typically belongs within a masculine domain. The Virgin, having become pregnant and birthing a child miraculously, as well as being the only human after Christ’s death to have not suffered a bodily death,[17] reveals how the feminine can fit into the conception of the divine without becoming masculinized in some way. In her essay “Stabat Mater,” Julia Kristeva asks, “If it is not possible to say of a woman that she is..., would it perhaps be different concerning the mother, since that is the only function of the ‘other sex’ to which we can definitely attribute existence?” (161). If not knowing man sexually, as Eve did, somehow precludes her from some construct of the feminine, then the expression of motherhood with its pregnancy and bodily nourishment of the infant must call her back into that domain. 
That domain of motherhood, however, is not reserved for women. Christ is frequently a nurturer, who literally provides sustenance to his followers through his body and blood via transubstantiation during every Catholic mass. If one were to argue that corporeality and nourishing were exclusive to a feminine expression of spirituality, in Christ exists the clear exception. Caroline Walker Bynum discusses the parallelism between the Virgin’s breast and Christ’s wound, compellingly arguing that the art historical record that positions Christ’s wound close to the breast is purposeful and telling.[18] Like Mary, too, and noted by Augustine, he is positioned as “Mediator of God and humanity, the man Jesus Christ,” existing simultaneously in the earthly and spiritual realms (1 Tim 2:5).[19] As the virgin son of God and the virgin Mary — a woman — Christ is without a flesh and blood direct male ancestor, rendering him a gender outsider.[20] 
We must keep in mind that historically, blood has at times been gendered, as James White notes, “In medieval medical theory, blood was understood as the precursor to all other bodily fluids, including sperm and breast milk” (167). Thus, when Catherine equates the fragrance of her blood to that of Niccolò di Toldi,[21] she is suggesting that her blood is masculine rather than feminine. And for Christ, the opposite may well be true, as his human bloodlines are feminine, and as his blood is used in the production of a nourishing liquid. Catherine also constructs a “female Christ,” as F. Thomas Luongo has argued with regard to the language of Letter T273 that seems to reverse the traditional understanding of the Song of Songs, with Christ as the “sweet bride” who receives the masculine bridegroom soul in penetrative language (“Catherine of Siena: Rewriting the Female Holy Authority” 95-97).[22] Christ is in many ways tied to nourishing and motherhood, and though he can be complicated as a feminine figure, he is still often cast as masculine and thus decidedly outside of the traditional realm inhabited by female. Roland Barthes suggests a new conception of the maternal: “Perhaps one should end up with this: ... no longer automatically confusing mother and woman. In which case, the androgyne would be any subject within whom there is something maternal” (194). It is therefore necessary to claim the maternal as outside of woman, and fitting with a shifting, inconstant or outlying gender identification.
In Kristeva’s essay on the Virgin, she evokes not only milk but also tears as a non-verbal semiotics (174). While the milk is the symbol of nourishment, the mother’s tears are an expression of a sorrowful humanity; as a mother one is the symbol of life who also functions as the veil of inevitable death. However, again, it is not only women and mothers who cry — Abraham weeps out of mourning for Sarah in Genesis 23:2, David weeps occasionally in the Books of Samuel, Christ weeps in John 11:35 and Hebrews 5:7, Peter weeps bitterly after denying Christ in Matthew 26:75, Gregory the Great introduced the phrase “lacrymarum gratia” in his 6th-century Dialogues, sorrowful tears and the tears of his mother are a recurring motif in Augustine’s Confessions that factor into his conversion, tears were an important aspect of medieval monastic life for men,[23] and hagiographical records of Francis of Assisi note that his copious tears contributed to his eventually becoming blind. Arguably, each of these cases of tears are expressing sorrowful humanity, and are also spiritual utterances that are not constrained by corporeal states of sex, sexuality, or gender. The tears of men may not cause one to question their masculinity, but they do complicate the gendering of these emotional performances as ipso facto feminine. Kristeva’s nonvocal semiotics of the mother can be extended to be part of a mystical semiotics that exists outside of speech and written word (as in Francis’s case), but should not be limited in its conscription to the domain of womanhood, as mothering and its expressions are not bound to a singular gender.
The figure of the virgin, who is determinedly outside of sexuality, and typically does not participate in the expression of motherhood as in Kristeva’s discussion of Mary, is even less easily gendered. For many, the virgin is in a privileged gender space, especially when the virgin is a woman. For many thinkers, the female virgin is so esteemed that she is rendered man. The Church Father, Jerome wrote, “long as women is for birth and children, she is as different from man as body is from soul. But when she wishes to serve Christ more than the world, then she will cease to be a woman and will be called man” (Bullough 227). Jerome utilizes the theological  dichotomy of body and soul to compare the state of woman and man, aligning women with a corporeal material state and men with a transcendent divine-reaching state. However, women who choose not to engage with what many of the pre-modern period would believe to be their biological destiny, can transcend their flesh-oriented state, and rather than produce more of humanity, can approach God. 
However, some Christian thinkers situate virginity as outside of a binary construction of gender. In an illustrated account of her mystical visions from the 12th century, the Scivias, Hildegard puts forth that married sexual life can be a fine choice for a Christian when done with care, but the corporeal state of virginity would always be preferable. Throughout her writing, she conflates “virginitas” with “viriditas” (greenness) and “virilitas” (virility) — for Hildegard and her contemporaries, words were valid signifiers for that which they signified. Thus, the virgin is a green and ripening fruit that pulls its power from the sun, rendering greenness to be a vital force that can be easily reconciled with the notion of virility. With these similarities in mind, both male and female “green” virgins prove to be not only virile, but the most virile of humans as virginity has more viridity (thus virility) integral to it than any other state of being. Indeed, in her Symphonia no. 19, Hildegard refers to the female-bodied Virgin Mary as “viridissima virga,” a phrase that encompasses several distinct meanings. Literally, the phase translates to “greenest branch,” while also connoting “greenest rod,” which can refer to the male sexual organ. Because the word “virga” is so close to the word “virgo,” the literal word for “virgin” is also conflated with the phrase’s meaning. The ambiguity places the idea of the virgin in an undefined and multimodal space that inhabits the tension of virile sexuality and lack thereof. The male-bodied virginal Saint Rupert of Bingen is described as “dulcis viriditas pomis”[24] (no. 49, 4a), a “vas nobile / quod non est pollutum,”[25] and a “sarcina sine medulla”[26] (no. 49, 4b). Rupert is a green fruit, and a container that is both unsoiled and lightness, suggesting a lack of sexuality in both figurative and physical terms. Though Maud Burnett McInerney argues that Hildegard represents Rupert through a “feminization of his body,” it seems to me that Hildegard is actually working to position the virgin within a separate class in and of itself (149). That is, the greenness that Hildegard describes is not in some way aligned with femininity, or even masculinity despite its connection to virility, but exists as an especially virile condition that is amplified for having been taken out of a sexual economy and gender. 
The figures of the mystic as well as the saint, whether virgin or not, are also in many ways beyond gender, just as they remain as individuals outside of the political life of society. Employing shifting subjectivity throughout her text Das fliessende Licht the beguine mystic Mechthild of Magdeburg has the allegorical Lady Knowledge instruct the soul: “You are a virile man in battle, a well-dressed virgin in the palace before your Lord, and a joyous bride in your bed with God”[27] (II.19). That is, the figure of the mystic is man, virgin, and bride all at once — alternately courageous and pugnacious, courtly, ecstatic. With all of the recasting of gender in Song of Songs by religious thinkers, it is interesting to consider that in the Legenda aurea, Jacobus de Voragine describes Saint Sebastian as the saddle in between Christ-the-horseman and Church-the-horse. Though Sebastian has recently become an iconic saint for the LGBTQ community due to frequent homoerotic paintings of his martyrdom throughout art history,[28] Voragine was likely not consciously depicting Sebastian as inhabiting a third gender between the presumably masculine Christ and presumably feminine Church, though the imagery is decidedly sexual. Not only does Voragine evoke the Song of Songs,[29] but horseback riding as well, which was typically understood to be a metaphor for sexual relations throughout the medieval period.[30] In occupying the space between the masculine and the feminine, as the saddle between horse and rider, Sebastian can skillfully negotiate both spaces, or else be entirely outside either. Famously penetrated by all those arrows as one of his trials of martyrdom, Sebastian can occupy the positionality of the sexual female, while simultaneously holding military rank, which was traditionally reserved for the masculine domain. Though not described as a mystic, throughout his saintly life, Sebastian exemplifies the complicated gendering of the religious figure, which is even more problematized when the religious figure is also engaging with mysticism. 
Mystics in particular reject many of the traditional and typically masculine forms of Christian worship: the desert fathers and mothers rejected all societal and gendered context by separating themselves from civilization, cloistered and anchorite mystics separated themselves from society at large and the gender binary more specifically, and itinerant mystics like Catherine chose to live unconventional lives that were unattached to norms imposed by gender roles. As Bonaventure writes, the Franciscans prayed not on ecclesiastical books and did not chant the canonical hours, but prayed humbly to the Cross of Christ and on other religious objects, suggesting that they were not interested in praying in a learned and erudite manner (which would have been limited to male Christians at the time) (IV, 3). Further, Bonaventure explains how the Franciscans believed that to achieve grace, one should renounce the wisdom of the world as well as his knowledge of letters, and thus dispossessed of such inheritance to go naked to the Lord (VII, 2). This teaching, which is certainly in keeping with Francis’s own biographical experience of renouncing his earthly possessions and father’s profession by rendering himself naked in a piazza of Assisi,[31] rings true for all mystics — without the accoutrements of clothing and societal performance, these figures are without gender, class or societal status, and are instead like the homo sacer. 
Many mystics — more than denying themselves clothes, educational capital, belongings, and manneristic performance — tried to deny themselves of their body as well. Though Caroline Walker Bynum and Rudolph M. Bell discuss the many holy women who denied themselves food,[32] and the fasting Catherine would also limit her sleep to half an hour out of every period of two days, bodily denial was not limited to feminine spiritual practices. Hair shirts and flagellation were typical expressions of corporeal mortification and suffering across gender, whether to prevent sexual urges or in an attempt to no longer feel the body at all. In addition to sleeping on hard surfaces and a diet devoid of meat and cooked vegetables, in one hagiographic episode, Francis flees to the cold snow outside to dispel his desires. Writing on Spanish mystics including Juan de los Ángeles and John of the Cross, Maureen Flynn explains how negating the temporally-bound body proved to be a means to fully incorporate the soul more purely with God, allowing the individual’s core of the immortal soul to rid itself of sensory and mental faculties to transcend (“The Spiritual Uses of Pain in Spanish Mysticism”). This is to say, that even if we do not follow Judith Butler’s view that sex is just as much of a construction as gender is, these practices show that not only are mystics divorcing themselves from gender but they are trying to remove themselves from corporality: going naked to the Lord means ridding oneself not just of clothes but of the body as well. Mystics are working to exist on the Earth just as they eventually will in Paradise, as genderless, sexless, body-less immortal creatures of God. 
Although religious and holy figures engage with many of the same negotiations of sex, gender, and social status that mystics do, the mystic is in a special situation due to their direct access to God. As Helen Rolfson writes (128):
The mystic speaks of God as of the partner in dialogue. What is said about one is reflected mirror-wise in the other… The prayers of Catherine of Siena beautifully demonstrate this reciprocity… As William of St. Thierry puts it: “True friendship either finds or creates equals.” No friendship is based on inequality. The mystic is very aware that that offer of divine friendship has been extended to one who is anything but God’s equal. 
Though mystics do not perceive themselves to be the equal to God, they see themselves to be a partner and a friend, which is a condition that approaches God unlike any other state of being. The unique relationship between mystic and God is often viewed as one in which the mystic serves as a conduit for God’s word, but, as Rolfson suggests, it proves to be more of a working and reciprocal partnership. And indeed, as Barbara Newman explains, often the mystic forgets the difference between the creature and the Creator, and “behaves as an equal” (144). Within this practice, the mystic’s conversations with God and the resulting writing that documents these dialogues act as another space in which the mystic serves to mediate. The mystic channels God’s direct teaching, filters it through her experience and knowledge, and then releases it as a means to teach and nurture others. The language, as we will explore, is bound by earthly literary conventions and reveals the agency that the mystic has in her relationship to God’s word. 
        More than a partnership, of course, is the union with God that all religious followers experience to some degree, but which mystics more palpably participate in, through mystical marriages and spiritual transpositions. Catherine of Siena marries Christ, exchanges her  corporeal heart with his, wears his foreskin for a ring (as do all other Christians),[33] relates how her name is interchanged with Christ’s by Niccolò di Toldi,[34] and carries out God’s work in public spaces throughout her life. She is not alone, as Catherine of Alexandria, Teresa of Àvila, Rose of Lima, Francisco de Hoyos y Sena, and many others also experienced a mystical wedding, and still more wrote prayers and sermons on marriage with Christ.[35] Similarly, others take the place of Christ in certain instances: the martyrs suffer and sacrifice themselves as Christ did, Bernard of Clairvaux drinks Mary’s milk in the place of the infant Jesus; Margaret and other saints literally and allegorically beat the devil as God does in the Bible. Origen adimantios writes on the role of the soul as a mother to Jesus: “And every soul, virgin and uncorrupted, which conceives by the Holy Spirit, so as to give birth to the Will of the Father, is the Mother of Jesus,” thus emphasizing the constantly in-flux relationships between Mary and Christ, the soul and Mary, and the soul and Christ (Comm. on Mt. frg. 281 [GCS Origen 12.1:126.10-15]).[36] In commenting particularly on a pure soul, which is virginal and uncorrupted, Origen is limiting his pool of Christian followers dramatically, and speaks to the complicated role of the Virgin Mary, and the concept of the virgin as a figure that is on the peripheries of gender and in conflict with itself in many ways — at once a virgin and a mother. Moreover, Teresa of Ávila notes in her writing that she lived only through God being within her;[37] the missionary mystical writer Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza appropriates Christ’s voice, and Angela de Foligno identified with Christ throughout her writing (Cruz 133-136). In many ways the mystic is not only married with God, but combined with him, and more often with the Son of God specifically, exchanging body parts, voices, and positions with him. 
The union with God, whether it is perceived as the result of a mystical marriage or not, leads to another positionality that is difficult to locate. Iacopone da Todi writes of the union with God as a loss of self, tempering it paradoxically with some semblance of maintained subjectivity on the part of the soul who is both conquering and conquered (Laude 91, 154-8): 
como cera desfacto a gran foco mostrata,
En tanto sì reluce ad quello lume tracto,
tutto perde suo acto, volontate è passata.
La forma che gli è data, tanto sì l’à absorto,
che vive stando morto, è vincto e è victore.[38]
Evoking imagery of Song of Songs 8:6[39] through discussing wax, fire, and the imprint of God, Iacopone speaks of the soul melting away and being annihilated to the point of losing its will. However, through this process, the soul is absorbed by God to be paradoxically both the conquered and the conqueror. Hadewijch uses similar contradictory language of the union between the mortal soul and the divine in a letter (Letter IX) ,[40] 
From the depths of his wisdom, he shall teach you what he is and with what wonderful sweetness the one lover lives in the other and so permeates the other that they do not know themselves from each other. But they possess each other in mutual delight, mouth in mouth, heart in heart, body in body, soul in soul, while a single divine nature flows through them both and they both become one through each other, yet remaining always themselves.
In this description, there is a knowledge that is cultivated through the union — not a knowledge of letters (though one may gain that from Mary’s breast milk), but a certain sweet and spiritual wisdom. Hadewijch blends imagery from the Song of Songs with more equitable ideas about marriage than what may have been available at the time of her writing: two lovers who are one yet maintain their own identity. Quoting William of St. Thierry, Bernard McGinn writes, “The mystical life consists of an ongoing oscillation between [ ... ] two stages — ‘...the man of God ought to be always either rational in seeking or spiritual in loving’” (The Growth of Mysticism 235). The “man” of God is always finding himself in a fluctuating position, shifting between not just two stages of rationality (an earthly state) and spirituality, but constantly negotiating among many different registers that are coded as human, divine and other. Like the recluses of Siena in the 13th and 14th centuries, the mystic is on the peripheries of the city, at its edges like the homo sacer. 
        Catherine, straddling many boundaries, manifests her identity in multifold ways. As a virile woman, she describes herself, the Pope, and her companions as knights on the battlefield fighting for the Church, with Christ leading the way. This militaristic imagery is employed in both her Dialogo (chapter 77) and in several of her letters, including T128 addressed to Gabriele di Davino Piccolomini, a married Sienese noble, in late 1377:
In questo modo noi, che siamo posti nel campo a combattere contro li nostri nemici, cioè contra il mondo, la carne e ’l dimonio, senza l'arme non potremmo combattere, nè ricevere li colpi che non ci offendessero. Che arme dunque è quella che ci conviene avere? Di coltello. Convienti anco avere la corazza della vera carità, la quale ripara e’ colpi, che ci dà il mondo indiversi modi, e a molte tentazioni del dimonio, e a’ colpi della nostra fragilità, che impugna contra lo spirito, come detto è.[41]
Catherine, as a knight among many others, casts herself in a way that is not unlike the figure of Joan of Arc, a Christian soldier who is fighting with a double-edged knife that serves to uphold charity and work against human frailty in the face of temptation. Raymond, too, acknowledges Catherine’s self-positioning as a woman who is virile and armed. When describing her mystical marriage to Christ, he writes that God says, “Age igitur filia viriliter amodo absque cunctatione quacumque illa, que ordinante mea providentia tuas deducentur ad manus, quia fortitudine fidei iam armata cunctos tibi adversantes feliciter superabis” (I.12.4).[42] Catherine will act in a virile manner without hesitation because she is armed with the strength of her faith and will overcome her adversaries. Again, she is cast as a knight going out to battle and not a cloistered woman, even when describing her mystical marriage which one may expect to be in a more heteronormative register. 
        On expressions of monasticism in Europe, Theodora A. Jankowski writes that there are two primary traditions for religious expression, that of the miles or soldier who battled Satan on Christ’s behalf, and that of the sponsa or bride of Christ, unified with him through love (62). What, she argues, is significant is that these two possibilities are “interchangeable in terms of gender. A male virgin could be considered a sponsa; a female virgin could be considered a miles … genderless images of the soldier and bride of Christ allowed [female monastics] to act in the same way as male monastics” (62-63). Existing in a way that can conflate traditions allows religious figures, both male and female, to occupy spaces that were reserved for what society considered the opposite sex. In her book Tendencies, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick writes (8), 
That’s one of the things that “queer” can refer to: the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone’s gender, of anyone’s sexuality aren’t made (or can’t be made) to signify monolithically.
Queerness allows for greater possibilities, enabling individuals to fill in gaps, create opportunities for lapses, and exist in multiple fluctuating places within a spectrum of gender or sexuality. Catherine, and many other mystics, took advantage of the conflation of “dissonances and resonances” within their respective communities. Because the idea of the sponsa and the miles resonated so successfully as symbols for monastic life, both male and female religious were able to occupy those spaces, despite the dissonances between genders in a binary society.
        Jankowski’s project is around the notion of queer virginity, and is a good place to consider the recasting of mystics as they often exist as virgins in their natural lives (6-7):
I have chosen to use the term “queer” to define or categorize the position of the adult virgin primarily because of the inclusivity of the term … focus[sing] on the way in which the notion of “queer” or “queerness” allows a space for examining issues of sexuality that are not restricted to the binary axis of homo- versus heterosexuality.
Since virgins are outside of what is a binary sexual landscape, they are queer. From Jankowski’s work, I would like to expand this definition. Including celibates is an obvious move, but I contend that queerness can exist outside of a definition of sexuality, and carry over to expressions of gender and expressions of otherness in more general terms. Heather Webb writes on the masculinity of the heart in medieval literature, discussing how writers like Catherine and Dante can allow for masculinity across variously sexed bodies (138-9):
For Catherine, as for Dante, the gendered notion of vital heat and its association with the capacity for outward propulsions does not enforce a limiting binary. This idea of gender relies on gradation or continuum, allowing for a significant amount of play in the temperatures and extrusive or projective power associated with the sexes. The concept of the heat of the heart allowed these writers to reevaluate the key characteristic of masculinity as a quality that was derived from virtue, from the reception of divine gifts within the body, and from the desire to pull something forth in response to that gift — to give back.
In styling masculinity as an aspect from virtue, Catherine can occupy the space of masculinity, claiming it as a quality that she possesses. She is both soldier and bride of Christ, existing across a spectrum of identity.
In her article “Orientations: Toward a Queer Phenomenology,” Sara Ahmed defines the act of queering as such (565):
To make things queer is certainly to disturb the order of things. The effects of such disturbance are uneven, given that the world is already organized around certain forms of living — certain times, spaces, and directions. It is important to make the oblique angles of queer do this work, even if it risks placing different kinds of queer effects alongside each other.
Queering disturbs the order of things. Catherine, as someone marked as woman, inhabiting various edges of society — located in spaces that are not typically authorized for someone of her sex, class, education level — disturbs the order of things. She acts as a soldier, as a bride, has a masculine heart beating in her chest, claims a grassroots education, achieves literacy, writes to people in positions of power, preaches in piazzas, empowers the disenfranchised in her city. Claiming power through an intimate relationship with the divine, and existing in a space between this world and the next, she is disturbing established hierarchies, using her own self-knowledge, mystically-obtained knowledge, and community-based knowledge to, in time, become a sanctioned teacher of the Church. And Catherine is not alone in this impulse — many mystics throughout history, as described above, work to disturb the order of things.
The mystic is a borderless figure, gendered queer and an amalgamation between nature and divine, fluctuating between a this-worldly direction and an other-worldly focus. Like the Latin American figure of Santa Muerte, a skeleton saint who travels beyond borders with migrants who carry her and is considered to be at once folkloristic as well as holy, the mystics operate within a similar space: by being sacred they are othered. Nomadic, whether by being an earthly itinerant preacher or a divinely transcendent anchorite, the mystic passes through borders freely yet is bound by them, and persists as a figure of tension that holds “incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true,” paradoxically shifting between rational language and erotically charged spiritual language, the sense of being nothing and everything at once in union with, yet separate from God (Haraway 161). 
In her “Manifesto,” Donna Haraway discusses the nature of writing, communication, and gender (176): 
Writing is pre-eminently the technology of cyborgs... Cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism... These are the couplings which make Man and Woman so problematic, subverting the structure of desire, the force imagined to generate language and gender, and so subverting the structure and modes of reproduction of ‘Western’ identity…
Though writing much later than many of the mystics discussed in this chapter, Haraway contends that writing is still the primary technology of cyborgs, subversion, and struggling against status quo and dogma. When desire is subverted and restructured, language and gender can be as well. The mystic that operates on a separate plane, desiring nothing of this world, and engaging both spiritually and erotically with the other world, as well as conflating, erasing, and otherwise bending subjectivities with the divine, proves to be in a critical position that undermines traditional power hierarchies. Even Catherine’s use of the literary vernacular speaks to this crucial aspect of her mysticism and identity, as she uses writing to struggle against structures of literacy and to speak of the ineffable in language that cannot quite contain divinity (see below). Rather than fixed in sex and identity, Haraway writes, “Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment,” and, moreover, the queer cybernetic mystic might consider the partial, fluid, and sometimes-state of mortality and immortality, human and non-human (as they approach divinity), within and without (180). A paradoxical figure, the mystic, like the texts that they leave behind, operates within the periphery: between and among, folklore and canon, erudite and wise yet uneducated and sensing.
Returning to Freud’s claim that “Mysticism is the obscure self-perception of the realm outside the ego, of the id,” and considering that the id also dominates psychological development prior to the phallic stage of sexual awareness and gender expression, it is possible to see how mystics are working outside of a sexual economy, outside of gender, and outside of typically human forms of consciousness. In her lyrical text, Teresa, My Love, on the mystic Teresa of Àvila, Kristeva evocatively captures the situation of the mystic (26):
Hail Teresa, borderless woman, … made word, made flesh, who unravels inside and outside herself, ... too much body yet disembodied, beyond matter, ... throbbing for the Beloved ever-present and yet never there, ... His in her, hers in Him, ... La Madre being the most virile of monks, most canny of the herders of souls, a veritable twin of Christ, she is He, He is she, the Truth is me, or Him in the deepest part of me, me Teresa…
Both experiencing excessive flesh and disembodiment, the mystic and Christ join together, becoming a being outside of humanity, society, and economics. In her Dialogo, Catherine writes of Christ as a bridge, a means for Christians to avoid the tempestuous sea of this life and cross over into the next in union with God (21-22):
Perciò Io, volendo rimediare a tanti vostri mali, vi ho dato il ponte, che è mio Figlio, affinché, passando il fiume, non annegaste. Il fiume è il mare tempestoso di questa vita tenebrosa. … tu veda la sua grandezza, che si estende dal cielo alla terra: rimira, cioè, come la terra della vostra umanità sia unita in Cristo colla grandezza della Divinità. Per questo ti dico che esso va dal cielo alla terra, appunto a causa di quella unione, che io ho fatta nell’Uomo-Dio. [43]
Though Christ is a special case in that he is literally half-human and half-divine, the mystic, in her union with him, occupies a similar space. A bridge that spans over this world and ushers others into Paradise, the mystic joins the earth with the divine. The mystic is a conflation of so many seemingly contradictory yet in flux states of being. Despite these multivalent experiential states, there is an interest in self-construction among mystics that is beyond the constraints of society in general, and instead approaches a transcendent state of being that is yet still operating within temporal language and space. In this way, the mystic is within and without, straddling the border between the active and contemplative, the masculine and feminine, the earthly and the divine — and serving as a bridge that complicates these boundaries and fuses them together.

[4] “l’histoire de sainte Catherine de Sienne est significative; c’est au sein d’une existence tout à fait normale qu’elle se crée à Sienne une grande réputation par son active charitéet par les visions qui manifestent son intense vie intérieure; elle acquiert ainsi cette autorité nécessaire au succès et qui manque généralement aux femmes; on fait appel à son influence pour exhorter les condamnés à mort, ramener les égarés, apaiser les querelles entre familles et cités. Elle est soutenue par la collectivité qui se reconnaît en elle, et c’est ainsi qu’elle peut remplir sa mission pacificatrice, prêchant de ville en ville la soumission au pape, entretenant de vastes correspondances avec évêques et souverains, et finalment choisie par Florence comme ambassadrice pour aller chercher le pape à Avignon” (169).
[5] “Let nothing keep her from doing good with holy desire — whether it be diabolical temptation or carnal weakness ... Nor should her neighbors’ ingratitude or lack of recognition or appreciation keep her from serving them and seeking their salvation. If it did, it would seem that she was looking for some reward from them rather than from God, and she should prefer death to that!” (Trans. Noffke)
[6] “AlI want is love. In loving me you will realize love for your neighbors, and if you love your neighbors you have kept the Law. If you are bound by this love you will do everything you can to be of service wherever you are.” (Trans. Noffke)
[7] Catherine is not formally tried for witchcraft, but friends, family and her first confessor believed that her refusal to eat may have been the work of a demon. For more on this, see Rudolph Bell’s chapter, “I, Catherine” in his monograph Holy Anorexia, 1985. 
[8] As McGinn notes, “God lies beyond all distinctions of gender and the ordinary realms of consciousness” (Flowering of Mysticism 169).
[9] This is divergent from Genesis 2.21-22, where Eve is constructed from the rib of Adam. Genesis 1.27 is closer to Genesis 5.1-2, though I contend that Genesis 5 is clearer in its meaning that both Adam and Eve are understood to be in God’s image, whereas Genesis 1 and 2 could be argued that Adam is created in God’s image while Eve may not be.
[10] “But I beg you, O Lord — if it is not too presumptuous of me — how can I, wretched and frail as I am, be of use to souls? My sex, as you know, is against it in many ways, both because it is not highly considered by men, and also because it is not good, for decency’s sake, for a woman to mix with men” (90).

[13] Ambrose similarly conflates the Bride with the image of the preacher, and refers to her/his breasts; see Expos. Ps. 118 6.18 (ed. Petschenig, p. 117.16-25). Additionally, Ambrose applies the imagery of the Song of Songs to specific individuals and events, including Emperor Valentinian II’s ascent into heaven (The Foundations of Mysticism 212).
[14] As McGuire notes this is in part owed to linguistic similarities: “the happy coincidence of the latin terms LAUDANS ET LACTANS” (200).

[17] Mary’s assumption into Heaven is not strictly a Biblical text, but the Catholic Church interprets chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation in reference to it and as written into doctrine by Pope Pius XII in 1950 (Munificentissimus Deus). Apocryphal accounts regarding Mary’s assumption have circulated since at least the 4th century. In the Old Testament, two men are ambiguously described as being taken away by God rather than dying in a bodily way: Enoch (Genesis 5:24) and Elijah (2 Kings 2:11).

[29] Within the tradition of Christian allegory, with many commentaries written in the Middle Ages, the female protagonist of the Song of Songs is identified both as the Church (the collective people of God) and as the individual soul of the Christian who approaches Christ (constructed as the male bridegroom).
