A series of letters in particular, to Daniella da Orvieto &mdash; &ldquo;vestita dell&rsquo;abito di Santo Domenico,&rdquo; a </span><span class="c0 c3">mantellata</span><span class="c2 c0">, who later attained the state of blessedness, but of whom we do not know many historical details &mdash; are particularly provocative and show the full register of Catherine&rsquo;s writing to women. Daniella is the recipient of four very long and intense letters that were written between the fall of 1378 and early 1380. She appears to be viewed as a spiritual equal by Catherine, though perhaps younger, and seems to have been trying to imitate Catherine&rsquo;s extreme fasting and penance (Noffke 232). Catherine offers advice and guidance to Daniella, as she does to many similar women in terms of health, behavior and voice, but she also presents some contradictory suggestions. As to whether a woman should speak freely, as Catherine did, or resign herself to silence, to Daniella Catherine recommends both. This appeal to both speaking and silence suggests that a female voice must follow a certain paradoxical standard, or may evolve from one approach to the other. Also, though Catherine does tend to emphasize the corporal, with Daniella this is pronounced. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0">Her first letter to Daniella is T65, believed to have been dated in September or early October 1378. Focusing on the consecrated life, T65 is very similar to a letter written to William Flete (T64) and a section of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;on &ldquo;Truth.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;In fact, because letters T64 and T65 predate the composition of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;these letters (as well as T272 written to Raymond which presents a mini-outline of the </span><span class="c0 c3">Libro</span><span class="c0">) &ldquo;would later be amended and inserted in [the </span><span class="c0 c3">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">] through a typical process of interpolation&rdquo; (Ragazzi 46). This is to say that the letters prove to have as much literary merit as her </span><span class="c0 c3">Libro</span><span class="c0">. Each of the letters T64 and T65 follow a parallel structure, but the endings of each are unique and the similar content &ldquo;is used in each letter with quite different intent&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c0 c3">Letters</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;vol. III, 232). In T65 to Daniella, Catherine first mercilessly analyzes the dangers of the ascetic life (though she was clearly a practitioner), then rises to the ardent contemplation of divine love. She discusses two points in particular that she wants Daniella to observe: to be absent of judgmental thoughts of fellow humans, and to understand the importance of a life of mortification (a life that Catherine believes they have both been called to). By the end, however, she writes very personally on her own failings at moderation, &ldquo;Dolgomi io miserabile, che non seguitai mai questa vera dottrina; anco, ho fatto il contrario, e pero mi sento d&rsquo;essere caduta spesse volte in dispiacere e in giudizio del prossimo&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;(T65). Catherine divulges her own difficulties in moderating her practice of penance and in judging others&rsquo; practices, wrongfully having believed that if they were not as self-punishing as she that they were not worthy of divine light. In this way, the letter offers Catherine herself as a human being who is not always a supreme example of spiritual devotion, allowing a personal register alongside her more general and mystical approach to offering guidance.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0 c2">Although in many ways Catherine of Siena acted as an extremely public figure, she also worked to harmonize her life in terms of an outside, public-facing life alongside a meditative life of self-imposed private contemplation. Daniella attempted to live extremely ascetically in a self-imposed cloister, following a more traditional expression of female spirituality. Catherine, too, makes use of this trope, and to some of her letter recipients, she addresses the concept of the &ldquo;cell of self-knowledge.&rdquo; For Catherine, this is dualistic in nature as it requires a mental cloistering of the self while going about as a person in the world amid earthly obligations and distractions. In one letter to the Countess Benedetta Salimbeni, this image is particularly lucid. She writes about the planting of the tree of love for God, explaining where it should be planted (T113):</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">La terra &egrave; la vera umilt&agrave; &hellip; e &lsquo;l luogo, dov&rsquo;ella &egrave;, &egrave;&rsquo;l giardino chiuso del cognoscimento di s&egrave;. Dico che &egrave; chiuso, perch&egrave; l&rsquo;anima che sta nella cella del cognoscimento di s&egrave; medesima, ella &egrave; chiusa, e non &egrave; aperta, cio&egrave; che non si diletta nelle delizie del mondo. &hellip; &nbsp;non spande il cuore suo per confusione n&egrave; per tedio di mente&hellip;. Anco si serra e si chiude colla compagnia della speranza e col lume della santissima fede.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">This description of self-knowledge as an enclosed garden resonates with the idea of the cloister, but is kept inside oneself, rather than the more traditional and opposite approach of keeping oneself within a cloister. The person who has this garden or cell can lock herself up in it, and not take part in worldly delights, though she is part of the world. By cultivating her own self-knowledge, Catherine was able to maintain a private internal refuge for herself to continue her solitary contemplation of God while publicly doing God&rsquo;s work in the world. </span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0">Through living within harmony between public and private, Catherine also advises other women to strike this moderate accord that acknowledges spiritual life but directs energy toward the eternal life. In letter T61 to Monna Agnesa Malavolti and other </span><span class="c0 c3">mantellate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&mdash; perhaps Catherine&rsquo;s earliest surviving letter &mdash; Catherine meditates on Saint Agnes of Montepulciano and Mary Magdalen, pointing out the former&rsquo;s holy humility and the latter&rsquo;s passionate &ldquo;drunken&rdquo; love. It is between this dichotomy of saints &mdash; the meek and the fervent &mdash; that Catherine advises the women to behave. She writes, &ldquo;io vi prego e vi comando che voi entriate in questo santissimo mezzo&rdquo; &mdash;&ldquo;I beg you, I command you: enter into this most holy middle,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;or as Tylus interprets it, this &ldquo;balance between the two saints&rdquo; (T61, 197). In either case it is necessary for spiritual women of the 14th century to paradoxically be both a cloistered mystical abbess like Agnes, and a public preacher and converter like the passionate Mary Magdalen. Catherine&rsquo;s own approach to balancing the public and private aspects of her life can be seen as a blend between Agnes and Mary Magdalen, as she worked to cultivate an inner cell and was blessed with intimate visions, while also doing charitable and political work in the world. In this manner, the addressees of this letter should learn to follow each of the saints, and find a proper equilibrium of neither too humble nor too ardent. The mediation between a quiet charity and an impassioned zeal also elucidates Catherine&rsquo;s advice regarding speech. That perhaps her fellow </span><span class="c0 c3">mantellate</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;should still the tongue but not too much while also striving to be quite loquacious when speaking God&rsquo;s will.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0">In her second letter to Daniella, Catherine is explicit regarding the degree of moderation &mdash; or discretion as it informs the other virtues, as Grazia Mangano Ragazzi argues</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;&mdash; that Daniella must seek to balance worldly and spiritual affairs. This epistle, T213, is dated in mid-October 1378, and as Ragazzi notes, &ldquo;Tommaseo regards letter 213 as one of the masterpieces of Italian prose&rdquo; (78). Like Catherine in her teenage years, Daniella opted to remain in a self-imposed cell. She experienced difficulty due to her asceticism, and found herself very sick due to scoring her body to an unhealthy degree. Though Catherine makes clear that it is within normal spiritual bounds for Daniella to discipline her body so that it may be more compliant, she should not do so if she is weak from illness: &ldquo;Anco, debbe non solamente lassare il digiuno, ma mangi della carne: e se non gli basta una volta il d&igrave;, pigline quattro. Se non pu&ograve; stare in terra, stia in sul letto; se non pu&ograve; inginocchioni, stia a sedere e a giacere, se n&rsquo;ha bisogno.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;The implication here &mdash; that Daniella should not only give up fasting but eat meat, and eat it several times a day, and that she should repose as needed &mdash; indicates that her health is an important aspect of serving God. In this letter it is made clear that she does not expect the same fortitude of others that she expects of herself, and she does not wish others to be in poor health trying to follow her example. When writing to Daniella, we can see a caring and motherly Catherine who offers sound advice to others when they cannot follow the example that she herself puts forth as a mystic who constantly fasts and beats her own body.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c2 c0">The importance of health is central to Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality, as she acted as a force in the world. Those who have been to Siena today may have noticed the escalators that are located throughout the city in order to accommodate easier passage among the steep hills. Catherine, who did good works in her own city and traveled throughout Italy and to France in the 14th century, relied very much on her good health in order to accomplish her acts of community building, political engagement, and promoting the social good. Therefore it is in keeping with Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality to encourage Daniella to get better so that she may bring her entire body to bear on the production of charity. In this same letter, she delineates and dismembers the body to explain how the entire corporal being can be utilized for the word of God (T213):</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A tutte le membra del corpo d&agrave; ordine, acciocch&eacute; siano modeste e temperate: l&rsquo;occhio non ragguardi dove egli non debbe, ma dinanzi a s&eacute; ponga la Terra, e &lsquo;l Cielo: la lingua fugga il parlare ozioso e vano, e sia ordinata ad annunziare la parola di Dio in salute del prossimo, e confessare i peccati suoi: l&rsquo;orecchia fugga le parole dilettevoli, lusinghevoli, dissolute, edi detrazione, che gli fussero dette; e attenda a udire la parola di Dio, e il bisogno del prossimo, cio&egrave; volontariamente udire la sua necessit&agrave;. Cos&igrave; la mano nel toccare o nello adoperare, i piei nell&rsquo;andare; a tutti d&agrave; regola. E acciocch&eacute; per la perversa legge della impugnazione che d&agrave; la carne contra lo spirito, non si levi a disordinare questi strumenti, pone la regola al corpo, macerandolo con la vigilia, col digiuno, e con gli altri esercizii, i quali hanno tutti a raffrenare il corpo nostro.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">With this letter, which is offered as advice to another, we can infer how Catherine governs her own individual body parts. Though Catherine is loquacious, we must reason that her mouth is tempered to only speak and proclaim the word of God &mdash; never talking idly, as her ears must selectively listen, as her eyes must look to the ground or to the heavens, her feet run, and her hand touch and bring things to fruition. For Catherine, the hand and the tongue must work in harmony, which may be informed by traditional Dominican spirituality as it is consistent with the early preacher Humbert who writes that &ldquo;one should preach not only with his voice, but with all that he is&rdquo; (Tylus 184). Not only must Catherine bring her voice to bear on sharing the word of God, but she must make use of her body as well.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the tongue in this letter may be of particular interest, as Catherine recommends neither that a woman speak freely nor that she should resign herself to silence &mdash; indeed, she advises that Daniella do both, suggesting that a female voice must follow a certain standard, or may evolve. Though other </span><span class="c0 c3">mantellate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;were certainly engaged in charitable works in hospitals and involved in lay society, Catherine was certainly the most politically and publicly engaged of her group. Her advice to other </span><span class="c0 c3">mantellate</span><span class="c0">, from letter T40 written in 1377, addressed to &ldquo;certain of her daughters in Siena,&rdquo; offers another compromise between conversation and choosing not to socialize: &ldquo;che questa purit&agrave; di mente e di corpo non si potrebbe avere con le molte conversazioni delle creature, n&egrave; col ponere l&rsquo;affetto e l&#39;amore nostro in loro n&egrave; in cosecreate, fuori della volont&agrave; di Dio.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Again, there is this emphasis that speech should be withheld when it does not serve God, and that speech is made acceptable when conversations occur within the realm of charity for God. When the </span><span class="c0 c3">mantellate </span><span class="c0">care for the ill in the hospital, they are to weep or rejoice with those who weep or rejoice: &ldquo;e godendo con coloro che godono, che sono veri servi di Cristo crocifisso; e sempre dilettarvi della loro conversazione&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;(T40). Catherine identifies two separate kinds of speech, but interestingly she uses the same word &mdash; &ldquo;conversazione&rdquo; &mdash; in both cases, causing the speech done outside of God&rsquo;s love and within God&rsquo;s love to be quite ambiguous. While Catherine can demonstrate that there are two ways to speak, and that women should indeed speak to serve God, women should not speak in all instances.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c2 c0">Letter T213, which is very lengthy within Catherine&rsquo;s corpus at 3,100 words, shifts to focusing more on the body and punishment of the body than it does toward speech acts and the tongue by the end of the text. Though there is a transition, Catherine continues to advise Daniella:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">io invito te e me a fare quello che per lo tempo passato io confesso non avere fatto con quella perfezione ch&rsquo;io debbo. A te non &egrave; intervenuto come a me, cio&egrave; d&rsquo;essere stata e essere molto difettuosa, n&eacute; d&rsquo;essere andata con larghezza di vita, e non con estrema, per lo mio difetto; ma tu, come persona che hai voluta atterrare la gioventudine del corpo tuo, acciocch&eacute; non sia ribello all&rsquo;anima, hai presa la vita estrema per siffatto modo, che pare che esca fuore dell&rsquo;ordine della discrezione</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Paradoxically, Catherine is both esteeming Daniella&rsquo;s commitment to asceticism as being greater than what she herself was able to achieve, and reprimanding Daniella for going beyond discretion. Catherine confesses that she has not been perfect in her complete humility, and she says this in close proximity to addressing again Daniella&rsquo;s body, with the description of it being youthful. Employing the noun &ldquo;gioventudine&rdquo; rather than the adjective &ldquo;giovane,&rdquo; she further emphasizes the idea of youthfulness, and in placing the &ldquo;tuo&rdquo; after &ldquo;corpo,&rdquo; the reader sees &ldquo;gioventudine&rdquo; and &ldquo;corpo&rdquo; in close succession. Despite a tone that is becoming more corporeally concerned, there is still the mother&rsquo;s scolding evident in this letter; the word &ldquo;estrema&rdquo; is used positively, but going out of the confines of discretion is unacceptable. Tylus notes that Catherine &ldquo;cultivated the persona of the &lsquo;mamma&rsquo; (perhaps partially to guard against sexual overtones of her relationships with young men her age),&rdquo; so this wavering between a maternal and more sexualized tone is not limited to Daniella in particular or her female companions in general (117</span><span class="c0">).</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The concern with the body coupled with the advice and even scolding of Daniella shows that Catherine has a special relationship with the young woman that differs in tone from many of her more friendly letters to other </span><span class="c0 c3">mantellate</span><span class="c2 c0">. </span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c2 c0">In early November 1378, Catherine writes letter T316 to Daniella in anticipation of a visit to Orvieto on her way to Rome. In this letter, she continues to offer advice to Daniella, explaining to her that she understands the tension between what the young woman is perceiving God is telling her to do, and what other religious are advising her to do. She encourages Daniella to respond to what she feels called to, and notes that both herself and Daniella enjoy being in the special light of God. This letter is full of literary symbols &mdash; though it was common in the Middle Ages to liken the Christ to a book, it is not often that we see two women in correspondence to each other discussing this. We know that both women are reading and writing as Catherine mentions a letter that she recently received from Daniella, showing again the community of literate women around her. Explaining the rule of eternal Truth, Catherine writes:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&hellip; scrissela nel corpo suo con lettere s&igrave; grosse, che veruno e di si basso intendimento che si possa scusare; non con inchiostro, ma col sangue suo. Bene vedi tu i capoversi di questo libro, quanto essi sono grandi&hellip;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">In this imagery, Catherine touches on the common tropes of Christ as parchment, his blood as ink, and the concept of God as author. Though this would likely be familiar imagery to people of this time, it is remarkable that it is written in the context of one woman to another. There are two other letters in which Catherine uses book imagery: T309 to Giovanni da Parma, and T318 to Sano di Maco and the other Christian laity of Siena. The first of these two letters, written to the layman Giovanni da Parma is dated October 23, 1377, and the second is written to a lay woolworking man and perhaps a mixed-gender group of her other followers, and is dated late January 1379. This second letter makes the imagery of Christ as book even more explicit in one phrase: &ldquo;scritta nel corpo suo: e fece di s&egrave; un libro,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;and contrasts the book of life and Christ with the book of sin and &ldquo;sensualit&agrave;.&rdquo; Catherine used this literary imagery in three different years of her letter production, but she only to lay people. These letters, particularly the letter to Daniella, assume a familiarity with books, and with large initials that would be contained in expensive manuscripts, suggesting that both women had some form of access to or knowledge about books and their design. The diction around books and literacy moves into Catherine&rsquo;s recommendation for Daniella to follow her own sensibilities, empowering her to not listen to those who she may wrongly think know more than she does, which seems validated after considering Daniella&rsquo;s knowledge of books, writing, and the eternal Truth of God. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of the letter, Catherine provides Daniella with more advice, telling her not to sleep, not to be negligent, to be humble, and to pray continuously:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Non dormiamo pi&ugrave;, destianci dal sonno della negligenzia, mugghiando con umili e continue orazioni sopra il corpo mistico della santa Chiesa, e sopra il vicario di Cristo. Non cessare d&rsquo;orare per lui, che gli dia lume e fortezza a resistere a&rsquo; colpi de&rsquo; dimoni incarnati, amatori di loro medesimi, i quali vogliono contaminare la Fede nostra.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">There is a focus on the mystical body of the Church, which is always rendered as a woman and is grammatically gendered feminine, bringing back a corporeal aspect to the letter. Then there are the fleshy demons who are &ldquo;amatori di loro medesimi,&rdquo; seeking to contaminate the Christian faith. In other letters, Catherine makes use of these two phrases &mdash; the lovers who love themselves and the &ldquo;dimoni incarnati.&rdquo; She typically discusses men who love themselves as being evil and seeking to do harm, as in a letter dated October 5, 1378 to Pope Urban VI: &ldquo;con desiderio di vedervi vestito del vestimento forte dell&rsquo;ardentissima carit&agrave;, acciocch&egrave; li colpi che vi sono gittati dagl&rsquo;iniqui uomini del mondo amatori di loro medesimi, non vi possano nuocere.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Her references to the incarnate demons are equally negative, though she only suggests that they could be likened to the letter recipient or other Christians in T190 to the tailor Francesco di Pipino and his wife Agnesa in late October 1378:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Voglio dunque che a questo abbiate una grande avvertenzia, di sempre conversare con i servi di Dio, e serve; e gli altri e l&#39;altre fuggire come fuoco. E non vi fidatemai di voi, dicendo: &laquo;io son forte, e non temo che questi mi faccia cadere&raquo;. ... Ma con vera umilt&agrave; cognosciamo che, se Dio non ci tiene egli, noi saremmo dimoni incarnati.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">This is to say that associating with those who have no faith can cause God&rsquo;s followers to lapse, even if they think they are strong enough to resist. Catherine makes it clear that without God holding on to us, we would all be devils in the flesh. </span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0">With these images in mind, let us continue to the last letter Catherine writes to Sister Daniella da Orvieto, dated to late 1378 or early 1379, T308</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0">Noffke glosses the tone of this letter as being &ldquo;quite general, except for Catherine&rsquo;s plea for prayer for the Church,&rdquo; but I believe it is unusual in its use of diction, though Noffke translates some of the distinctive phrases in a different manner (</span><span class="c0 c3">Letters</span><span class="c0">, Vol. IV, p. 64). Throughout this letter there is a focus on beauty, blood, and love. She uses the word &ldquo;bellezza&rdquo; five times in the first third of the letter, and she only uses the word &ldquo;bellezza&rdquo; in 54 of her letters total (just under 14% of her corpus of letters). The beauty she sees in Daniella is in her soul, innocence, and within &ldquo;his creature&rdquo; &mdash; which could refer to humanity in general or Daniella in particular. She also describes God being &ldquo;ebbro d&rsquo;amore&rdquo; (&ldquo;drunk with love&rdquo;) due to the beauty he finds in his creation, which is a common phrase throughout the </span><span class="c0 c3">Dialogo </span><span class="c0">(see Chapter 2 above), but only occurs in three of her letters.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;In the last few lines of T308 Catherine invokes the mystical image of bathing and drowning in Christ&rsquo;s blood, which appears in six letters and in some places in the </span><span class="c0 c3">Dialogo</span><span class="c2 c0">, but she also uses the phrase of Daniella and Catherine being &ldquo;amatori di noi,&rdquo; so similar to how she describes the demons in other letters. She writes:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">B&agrave;guati nel sangue, acciocch&egrave; scrupolo veruno non caggia</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;mai nella mente tua, n&egrave; per timore servile. Ma nascondianci nella caverna del costato di Cristo crocifisso, dove hai trovato l&rsquo;abondanzia del sangue. In altro modo anderemo in tenebre, e saremo amatori di noi. Considerando me che altro modo non c&rsquo;era, dissi ch&rsquo;io desideravo di vederti bagnata e annegata nel sangue di Cristo crocifisso: e cos&igrave; voglio che tu facci. Altro non ti dico. Permani nella santa e dolce dilezione di Dio: abbi fame del suo onore e desiderio. Ges&ugrave; dolce. Ges&ugrave; amore.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">This letter to Daniella seems particularly graphic and corporeal, even for mystical standards, because of its specificity. She discusses the ribcage of Christ &mdash; it is Christ&rsquo;s side and the blood there that correlates to Catherine&rsquo;s mystic vision. Generally, in Catherine&rsquo;s mystical vision as described in Heather Webb&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s Heart,&rdquo; there is the depiction of Catherine and Christ as containers of each other, depending on perspective. In this instance, though, it is Catherine and Daniella who are hiding themselves in the cave of Christ&rsquo;s ribs.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0">Though she does only mention bathing and drowning in the blood of Christ in six letters, Catherine does use the same imagery in a few instances in the </span><span class="c0 c3">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">, though sometimes she uses the word &ldquo;annegata&rdquo; in terms of drowning in the will of God rather than in blood. In </span><span class="c0 c3">Dialogo</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;131 she does explicitly mention drowning and bathing in the blood of Christ, both in the middle and towards the end of the section:</span></p><p class="c6 c10"><span class="c0">Passando subito per la porta stretta, che e il Verbo, e poich&eacute; &egrave; annegata nel Sangue, giunge a me, mare pacifico, essendo una stessa cosa io, mare pacifico, e la porta che &egrave; la mia Verit&agrave;, l&rsquo;Unigenito mio Figlio.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip; </span></p><p class="c6 c10"><span class="c0">Passano cos&igrave;, gloriosamente, da questa vita, bagnati nel Sangue, con la fame della salute delle anime, tutti affocati nella carit&agrave; del prossimo, attraverso la porta, che &egrave; il Verbo, ed entrano in me.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0">These two descriptions of drowning and bathing, respectively, in the blood of Christ can also be understood in general terms as it concerns the proverbial &ldquo;every man&rdquo; soul, or the specific soul that belongs to Catherine. Like the letter to Daniella, this imagery can be read rather erotically, as the sea and the gate are joined and made to be one and the same, facilitating the hungry blood-soaked souls to enter into the gate. Christ as gate seems to gender him as feminine in terms of both Italian grammar and in terms of being the open receiver rather than the souls that are pushing through (though these are also gendered feminine). The drowning and bathing imagery is corporeal, erotic and tends to connote Christ in feminine terms. This is also the case for letter T308 as it is Catherine and Daniella who are inside of Christ who receives them.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c2 c0">When Catherine writes to Daniella, is she hoping to share her mystic qualities with the woman in whom she sees so much of herself? Entering the darkness, Catherine and Daniella, together, will be lovers of themselves, with language identical to the letters that discuss demons who are loving themselves. This can be interpreted as falling under a category of self-love that is in turn love that is directed to God by virtue of the self being God&rsquo;s creation, but it is unusual that demons and wicked men are also engaging in this behavior throughout Catherine&rsquo;s letter corpus. This erotic language is therefore quite ambiguous when considered it alongside Catherine&rsquo;s common tropes. Why does she use this language, when it seems obvious that she would not want to liken herself or Daniella to sinners? The diction that includes shadows, hiding, and being lovers of ourselves,suggests that there may be more to their relationship with sin than may be obvious. In this short letter, Catherine soon has nothing more to say to Danella beyond stating that she would like to see the young nun be soaked and drowned in Christ&rsquo;s blood, and wanting Daniella to have &ldquo;hunger&rdquo; for God&rsquo;s honor and desire. Finally, as is customary, she ends the letter with the often employed &ldquo;Ges&ugrave; dolce, Ges&ugrave; amore,&rdquo; returning back to her use of the rhetorical structure of letters.</span></p><p class="c6 c7"><span class="c0">Erotic overtones are not unusual in medieval mystic writers, and, given that women who pursued religious vocations are said to be the wives of Christ, the eroticism directed towards the divine seems almost natural. Previous medieval writers such as Boccaccio and Heloise, among others, write about nuns with voracious sexual appetites in their stories and their letters.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Since we have so few texts from women living lives similar to Catherine, and given a context of eroticism in medieval religious literature, perhaps this current of corporeality is merely another transference of orality to textuality. &nbsp;As a bride of Christ, Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality is decidedly erotic at times, and it transfers to her followers &mdash; both female and male &mdash; on occasion. When writing to other women, many of whom were living in a way similar to her own life as </span><span class="c0 c3">mantellate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;who balanced their time between this world and the other world, Catherine conflates and complicates their relationships by being a friend, mother, possible lover, and religious leader, offering advice that would be difficult for anyone to follow due to its paradoxical nature, but in keeping with her own approach to spirituality.</span></p><hr class="c12"><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;Chapters 98-101.</span></p></div><div><p class="c1"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c2 c5">&nbsp;&ldquo;Wretch that I am, I regret that I have never followed this true teaching.
