English manuscripts, publishing and readership network
        Cristofano’s translation of Catherine’s Dialogo into Latin allowed for the circulation of the text throughout greater Europe, and is the basis for which the initial English translation of Catherine’s book was based on (Schultze 189). Eventually becoming known as the Orchard of Syon, the text may have been made available as early as 1420, which is also the year that first professions were made at Syon Abbey, five years after the placement of the foundation stone laid by Henry V on February 22, 1415 (Hodgson vii). The desire for a Bridgettine order in England likely began with the marriage between the daughter of King Henry IV, Phillipa, and the King of Sweden, Eric XIII of Pomerania. During her time in Sweden, Phillipa’s head lady-in-waiting was the noblewoman Lady Katarina Knutsdotter who was also granddaughter of Bridget of Sweden, and Phillipa served as a benefactor of and frequent guest to Vadstena Abbey, founded by Bridget in 1346 (Flemberg 181-92). The Syon Abbey was a project that was as component of Henry V’s effort to legitimize his dynasty, and proved to become the most important house for female religious established in England in the century prior to the Reformation. Remarkably, the abbey would survive into the twenty-first century, with the last nuns leaving as recently as 2011. 
Being the only house in England of the Bridgettines or the Order of St Saviour, which was founded by Bridget of Sweden, it was indicative of the ongoing movement of the time that spoke to renewal and reform in spirituality. It enjoyed great funding by Henry V, took a stand against Henry VIII’s project of the Reformation, and helped to develop Catholic recusant identity (Bainbridge 82). The role of Bridget of Sweden to the community should not be overlooked, as she was not a conventional saint, especially for contemporary English devotion at the time which was concerned with Lollardy. Notably serving as a model for the English religious figure Margery Kempe, the noble-born Bridget was not a virgin but instead was a married woman who bore eight children and was widowed following a pilgrimage she took with her husband to Santiago de Compostela. Upon the death of her husband, Bridget joined the Third Order of St. Francis and devoted herself to a life of prayer, caring for the poor and the sick, and developing her community of double monasteries where men and women could live in poverty but still have access to books. Syon itself was originally a doubly monastery, possessing a separate community with separate library each for men and women. We have inherited a large and thorough library catalogue from Syon Abbey that was preserved throughout the community’s exile in Lisbon during the post-Reformation. The collection is now housed at the University of Exeter.
In addition to Bridget’s interest in texts and literacy, community-building, and her status as a tertiary nun, she shared political aspirations with Catherine of Siena, traveling to Rome and working to return the papal seat there from Avignon. Along with being a biological mother, Bridget’s spirituality clashed with English religiosity due to her status as a mystic and a non-martyr, important because martyrdom served as the chief criterion for English sanctity from the early Middle Ages through the Reformation (Despres). English devotional practices, especially for women, were very restricted and continental figures that managed to develop a career of public spiritual advocacy and mystical practices would not prove to be suitable models. Though Margery Kempe suffered for her public displays of piety, Julian of Norwich’s position as an anchoress allowed her freedom to express her mystical experiences in texts. While 15th-century England does not immediately seem like a fitting environment for a figure like Catherine, not yet canonized, the local situation in the Bridgettine Syon Abbey seems like a more apt context for women to read an English translation of the Dialogo. 
        As a text alone, the Orchard of Syon does not provide much available information and data regarding its provenance or the purpose behind it. Inevitably linked with the Syon Abbey and its nuns, it was likely intended for the first generation of these nuns specifically, and its primary translator was an anonymous one. As C. Annette Grisé notes, Wynkyn de Worde’s printing of the Orcharde of Syon was “the first book to showcase its association with Syon and its nuns,” with the nuns being addressed directly in the second prologue and epilogue, in addition to woodcuts that are evocative of the female community there (“Syon Abbey and English Books,” 132). From there, many more books of the “Syon tradition” would establish references to the abbey among its framing materials, including the works of Richard Whitford in the 1520s and 1530s. The manuscript of this English translation of Catherine’s text was found within two copies according to an “Envoy,” was continued by another by the name of “Dan Jamys,” who may have been a monk in the Carthusian monastery of Sheen, across the Thames from the female Syon Abbey (Schultze 189). Though in many ways the text is a faithful one, the major changes are editorial in nature, which serve to completely recast Catherine’s unique spirituality to one that is more in-line with traditional English expressions of devotion. C. Annette Grisé maintains that “framing materials” — prologues, prefatory letters, woodcuts, incipits, explicits and title-pages — were deployed to establish what amounted to a spiritual provenance within Syon Abbey, leading to substantiating a form of legitimacy on the part of the community (136). 
Whether or not the prologue added this notion of a source, it is clear that the frame added to the Orchard served to allegorize the original Italian material, thus rendering Catherine’s concept of the vineyard and communal vineyards instead into a monastic image of a cloistered garden, and placing a greater emphasis on the “ghostly orchard” and “ghostly learning” rather than an active spirituality based on doing good works in the world. In addition to the framing narrative, another editorial intervention occurs that restructures the rubric, moving away from the Italian formulation. In particular, the English version moves the treatise on tears from its own position within the colloquies, to being appended to the fourth chapter on “Prayer.” Despres contends that this movement decreases the significance of tears in Catherine’s devotion and as a holy behavior independent of prayer, situating tears as a private form of worship and a component of praying in general terms (154). Though these interventions may be seemingly slight moves, and in many ways the women of Syon Abbey were still provided with access to the texts that Catherine originally wrote, rendered for them to read in their own vernacular language, the same textual control and attention to Catherine’s unique spirituality that were components of her reception in the Italian tradition are not preserved in England. 
        Though the editorial changes done by the English translators of Catherine’s dialogue suggest a closed-off and more private and contemplative approach to spirituality, the significance of a literate female community engaging with Catherine’s texts should not be overlooked. The provenance of a Brigittine monastery certainly points to an interest in literacy, reading and books, and the Syon Abbey exemplifies this tradition with its great output and preservation of texts through the years, even maintaining them while they were exiled in Lisbon. Reading practices within the monastery were not limited to private devotion, and were structured throughout the day in various ways, with reading done silently and out loud with the utilization of printed books and manuscripts, and done both within communal spaces and privately in cells (Bowden 187). Of course, the women who would become the nuns and abbesses of Syon Abbey were from an elite class as they were able to read, unlike Margery Kempe who could not read and edit the autobiography she dictated to her scribes. And indeed, these women circulated the books of Syon Abbey with a complex network of female lay patrons. In part due to a Carthusian influence of the 15th century, the laity were able to in part imitate continental ecstatic women, and were also able to intersect with the texts coming out of religious houses due to their having family members placed there. Denise L. Despres names Cecily, Duchess of York and mother of Edward IV; Alianore Roos; and Elizabeth Sywardby as among the female lay patrons who were most interested in reading continental devotional works. Though this should not necessarily suggest an extremely wide readership of Catherine’s work in English, the lay patrons who were interested in the textual production at Syon Abbey were likely the reason behind Wynkyn de Worde’s 1519 printed edition of the Orchard. 
        Manuscripts
        The two earliest extant manuscripts of Catherine’s Dialogo into English date from the first half of the 15th century: British Library MS Harley 3432, and Cambridge, St John’s College MS C.25. These first two editions are from the early history of Syon Abbey (Grisé, Syon Abbey in Late Medieval England, 50). The third extant manuscript is from the second half of the 15th century, Morgan M 162. There are additionally two manuscripts that contain a portion of the translation: an extract of part I, chapter 12 in Manchester, John Rylands Library, MS Latin 395; and an extract of part V, chapter 2 in Oxford, University College, MS 14 (Schultze 190). 
        Though these manuscripts are named for the Abbey, and though there is evidence that this text was read by the women there, and though Catherine of Siena was an important female figure worshiped alongside the Virgin and Bridget of Sweden, “there is a conspicuous absence of evidence of manuscript production in the great women’s religious houses in England,” at Syon or any other women’s religious house (such as Barking, Dartford, Shaftsbury, Denny) (Despres 147). Ian Doyle writes that while many cloistered women did not enjoy literacy, women belonging to prestigious religious houses owned “a good many books, both for prayer and for reading, in French and English, besides for worship in Latin, and there is no reason why some anonymous manuscripts from the better-educated houses … should not have been written, decorated and bound by them” (15). Therefore, though there is a clear connection between the Syon Abbey and its readership and ownership of the Orcherd of Syon, there is no concrete documentation that links the production of any of these manuscripts to the women or the Abbey outright.
        The earliest extant manuscript, the British Library’s Harley 3432 includes an incipit by an anonymous cleric who was most likely Carthusian, addressed to the “Religyuos moder & deuoute sustren, clepid & chosen bisily to laboure at the hous of Syon,” positioning this book within the context of the Abbey in an immediate way. This manuscript is exquisitely decorated, particularly at its celtic-knot initials with red, blue, green and white ink, and gold leaf, though some initials are left unfinished. For each new part, there is an emphasis on the border around the two columns of text, setting the structural parts off as discrete units. There is every indication that more decoration was intended for this manuscript as there are light marks in the rulings of many pages; good examples of this can be seen on pages 77r, 103v, 104r, 137r, 139r, and 174v.
Drawing of person in between two columns on 122v (male face in profile -- there is a reference to “poor men” in the text nearby). Most of the marginalia present seems to have been done by the original hand, in the form of citations or lengthy additions that replace cross-outs of the text in columns (as on 117r). Some marginalia includes decoration, including a drawing of a male face in profile between the columns on 122v — there is a reference to “poor men” in the proximate text.
There is also the marginalia of others in the book, including historically much more recent lightly done marginalia on 105r. At the beginning and last pages of the book there are many male autographs from the 16th and 17th centuries, showing clearly that this book continued to be seen as a luxury item, if not a text to read, throughout its life before its inclusion in the British Library. The material nature of the book reveals that there has been continued care, as some pages that were ripped were repaired with new vellum paper (not animal hide), as can be seen on pages 45, 50, 107 (small tear), 119, small repairs on 127 and 128, and on page 148. Some pages are ripped and repaired with new vellum (not animal hide), which can be seen on pages 21, 45, 50, slightly on 107, 119, small repairs on 127 & 128, 148. In the instance of page 21, it is possible to see that someone re-wrote the missing letters on the new vellum, which appears to have been added on the recto but transparent enough to see through to the verso. Though this repair was done with care it is an obvious remedy due to the use of much later paper. Despite this commitment to tending to the book, there is what appears to be a spill over some pages, particularly along the top, with pages 172-174 and 182-193 most damaged. These spills do not diminish the legibility, and instead suggest a continued engagement with the text beyond the book as a collectible. 
Among the signatures in the front and back of the book is one from Walter D’evereux, the 1st Devereux Earl of Essex. This became a book within John Batteley’s collection, who was a Church of England clergyman and antiquary. The Harley Collection purchased Batteley’s collection on November 5, 1723 (Wright 1966). Formed by Robert, Mortimer and Edward Harley, the Collection was bequeathed to Edward Harley’s widow Henrietta Cavendish, then to their daughter Margaret Cavendish Bentinck, and was eventually sold to the nation of England in 1753, forming one of the foundation collections of the British Library. The lifecycle of the manuscript points primarily to masculine readership or at least ownership through the 16th and 17th centuries, and eventually returns to female ownership before becoming part of a communal reading space more in line with its provenance.

        The Cambridge, St John’s College MS C.25 is in a much different style to the Harley MS, with plainer decoration and the vellum is smaller in size. Initials have some decoration in red and blue ink and include gold leaf, though initials were cut out in two instances, and the first three pages of the manuscript are no longer extant. There is some sketched floral decoration in black ink in the margins, as well as banner illustrations to show continuing text to aid those who would sew the pages together. There is some marginalia that highlights text with lines and curves, including playful marginalia that turns the curves into a face on 54r. There is light textual marginalia written in Latin on several pages. The ink of this text is very faint, and it appears that it could be in the original scribal hand, though this cannot be certain and may instead point to another contemporary reader. In either case, this marginalia indicates that there is some educated readership engaging with this manuscript that itself has been the result of intertextuality.

NOTES


This paper explores Catherine of Siena’s Dialogo as adapted into English as The Orcherd of Syon, currently in three extant manuscripts from the late 15th century, and as an early printed book done in 1519 by Wynkyn de Worde. Although Catherine’s Italian Dialogo was written for a general audience, the text was translated into English with the intended readership of the nuns of the Bridgettine Syon Abbey. Because the English translation utilized Raymond of Capua’s Latin translation of the text, the use of Latin as an intermediary language will be considered, as well as the gendered implications of a male rewriting the words of the female author for female readers. With an emphasis on the connections between Italian and English reception, as well as how expressions of spirituality were translated from the continent to England, this paper concludes with an examination of Catherine’s construction as a teacher of religious women.


        As this chapter will examine Catherine’s legacy within historical themes, in both Pre-Protestant and Post-Protestant England, I will divide it into two parts. The first section will analyze the Middle English translation of the Dialogo into the Orcherd of Syon for the cloistered Bridgettine Syon Abbey, and consider the text in relation to the history of the book and the gendered expectations of religious women in England. Secondly, I will analyze how the text of Stefano of Siena’s letter addressed to a Dominican priest represents Catherine as a maternal figure to Carthusian monks in England and the Sheen Charterhouse, and why this is of significance in terms of religious community-building. Lastly, this chapter will explore Catherine as a mystical literary figure in contrast to the mystical literary production of English religious women Margery Kempe and Julian of Norwich.
        The second section of this chapter will speak to the changing religious landscape in England as it shifts to Protestantism. The major text of this section is John Fenn’s 1609 translation of the Life of Catherine for English recusants, in contrast with both Raymond’s original version and Wynken de Worde’s 1492 English edition. Here, this chapter will investigate the cultural climate and how that influences the construction and reception of a literary Italian saint.


Women’s engagement with Catherine’s writing can be a little more difficult to analyze than men’s engagement with her writing, as we have written hagiographies on Catherine that discuss Catherine’s literary activity (Caffarini in particular is committed to Catherine’s textual production). There is suggestion that women did engage with her writing by the existence of more than one letter to the same woman, and the notion that Catherine did good works with those in her famiglia. In England, we have records of women bequeathing books containing Catherine’s writing to other women (in some cases from religious orders to family members outside orders) — nuns and devout gentlewomen being the most likely to be in possession of — or with access to — Catherine’s works. The English text of the Dialogue was adapted with a cloistered female readership in mind, as the translator’s introduction refocuses the text as a walled garden alluding to the cell of self-knowledge. In this way, Catherine’s many references to the vita activa are rendered allegorical. Within the canon of contemporary women writers, we see reference to Catherine in Margery Kempe’s Book, and we often see her listed in the catalogues of famous and virtuous women listed and profiled in proto-feminist texts like Marie de Gournay’s The Equality of Men and Women. Though she is considerably later, Lucrezia Marinella’s engagement with Catherine’s texts are the most interesting for me, with two sonnets and a heroic hagiography showing a literary continuity between the two women.


                Along with Teresa of Avila, Catherine of Siena became a Doctor of the Church in 1970 (Teresa was honored first in September, and Catherine in October), by Pope Paul VI. The two of them are the first two female Doctors, and there currently are four.  Having died in 1380, Catherine was canonized in 1461 by Pope Pius II. For Catherine, I believe that the situating of her as a saint within Latin texts was very important for her eligibility to receive the honors presented to her by the Church. Naming her as Doctor of the Church is a testament to her balance of the contemplative and active life, as Church Doctors are known for their deep religious knowledge and their preaching.
        Whether mysticism or her good works are more important in terms of her reception — throughout the Renaissance and by scholars and the Church today — is a more complicated consideration. Suzanne Noffke refers to Catherine as a “mystic activist” and I am inclined to agree that this is a more apt descriptor than “social mystic.” If Catherine had remained in her father’s house as a recluse, as she did in her earlier spiritual years, we would not have Catherine as a Church Doctor today, but it is exactly this interiority that is emphasized in the Middle English texts. Still, an Englishwoman like Margery Kempe, though she would only have had access to the English translation of the Dialogo, was well aware of Catherine’s concern with worldly affairs, and her and other active continental women seemed to influence Margery’s pilgrimages and public spiritual activity. The Renaissance reception in general does seem to be hinged on the dual-nature of Catherine’s spiritual mission — had Catherine been a closed-off mystic she would not have received the attention that she did and would not be considered so remarkable, especially today when scholars are well aware of the hurdles Catherine faced compared to her contemporaries.

* C. Annette Grisé sees the early appearance in print of original and translated mystical writings as regularly simplifying their originals; she notes a "shift towards a more didactic focus" and a favoring of shorter works "more suitable for a general devout audience" (p. 83). Mystical writing by holy women is generally played down in favor of "lives, extracts and prayers" offering holy examples to their readers. Grisé notes the probable importance of Syon as suppliers of religious material to the printers. Two full-length works commissioned by Syon, The Orcherde of Syon and The Myroure of Oure Ladye, may appear to buck the prevailing trend of short didactic works, but the contrast is, Grisé insists, more apparent than real: in particular, the readership of the Myroure was probably confined to professed religious, though since it provides a complete translation of the Birgittine Office it might just about be available for use by pious layfolk (cf. p. 88 n. 24) as a devotional exercise. 
* David Griffith shows us a different form of dilution, one partly explained by the form chosen for the material, panel painting?images of Sts Catherine of Siena, Birgitta of Sweden, and Elizabeth of Hungary?in parish churches in East Anglia and Devon. Griffith refers these paintings rightly to iconographie developments in manuscripts and early printed books, though, as he notes, the figures may owe as much to their new context, the saints depicted at the base of a rood screen, as they do to any manuscript sources.

      * Both local and papal authorities found mendicant devotion tolerable and useful, particularly in the fight against heresy in women
      * C’s particular sanctity, supernatural power, charitable activity, temporal power, evangelical activity → exemplification of Italian sanctity
* English sanctity was practically polar in many respects to Italian sanctity, particularly in the 15th c.
   * Martyrdom == chief criterion for English sanctity from the early Middle Ages through the Reformation
      * Thomas More, John Fisher, Thomas Becket, Edward the Confessor
      * Mendicant-influenced piety of the 14th c gave way among the literate to the extension of monastic devotions privileging the contemplative life 
* Two central issues pertinent to the translation of C’s Dialogue into English religious culture (p. 144):
   * (1) the fact that her visionary authority and apostolic spirituality confront priestly prerogatives, a deeply sensitive issue given the Lollard movement of the 14th & 15th c.s
   * (2) the fact that her spirituality, which elicited fervent active discipleship & imitation in Italy, would be foreign to and problematic for English imitation, given England’s 15th c religious traditions
* C’s Dialogue was ecstatically dictated in a particular cultural context that was not duplicated when the work was translated for or received by the nuns of Syon and other wealthy patrons
* Point of the essay:
   * Consider the influence and reception of The Orcherd of Syon from the few details known about its translation, transmission, manuscript ownership & Carthusian/Brigittine religious context
   * Real concern: purpose of reading mystical texts, whether or not reading could produce an imitative mysticism -- in C’s case requiring apostolic action
   * Hopes to show how the cultural and religious contexts of reception can actually limit or subvert the influence of a particular strain of mysticism, for C’s brand of mystical activism, shared by Margery Kempe & Elizabeth Barton, was transformed / defused for a spiritual “elite” beyond suspicion of heresy in 15th-c England
      * Women outside of this elite inevitably suffered persecution when they dared to write about or narrate their experiences
* C’s Il Dialogo was transcribed primarily during the autumn of 1378
   * Two earliest manuscripts translated into Middle English date from first half of the 15th c
      * BL MS Harley 3432
         * Incipit addressed to “Religyuos moder & deuoute sustren, clepid & chosen bisily to laboure at the hous of Syon” by an anonymous cleric, most likely Carthusian, who names his assistant ‘Dane (Dom) James’
      * Cambridge, St John’s College MS 75
   * Third from the second half of the 15th c
      * NYPL MS Morgan M 162 
   * Wynkyn de Worde edition -- 1519
      * Produced for well-to-do lay patrons
   * The Orcherd was originally received in England by the Brigittines
      * Necessarily adapted for women in an enclosed religious life
      * The translator recognized this, provides an appropriate meditative context through “allegorization” which indeed reinterprets and compromises,to some degree, Catherine’s apostolic mysticism 


* Catherine notes the duty of religious to say the Hours and exercise both vocal and mental prayer, and defines a third kind of “common” prayer
   * An active laboring in the Vineyards of Christ (that is, her apostolic service and political intervention), resultant from contemplative life
* Orcherd translator, however, bound by another ideal of service
   * Prologue: incorporates C’s imagery of the Vineyard of the soul and of Holy  Church, but transforms this allegory into a distinctly monastic image of an enclosed garden
   * Fruit and herbs are doctrine upon which to chew or meditate, thereby enriching spiritual labor
      * As opposed to the tilling of one’s neighbor’s fields described by C in her exposition of the Vineyard
   * His instructions put the text firmly in a mnemonic tradition of monastic readin (lectio) and composition
   * “Ghostly orchard” and “ghostly learning”


* Importance of books and reading at Syon has been amply demonstrated
* Meditative reading and rumination often resulted in composition
   * Collacion -- meditative period of reading that took place before Compline on Sundays, gathering together the scatterings of the mind
   * No  nun of Syon produced visionary, devotional or speculative responses
      * Surprising -- highly educated women well versed in hermeneutics of monastic reading and writing
      * There is a conspicuous absence of evidence of manuscript production in the great women’s religious houses in England
         * Syon
         * Barking
         * Dartford
         * Shaftsbury
         * Denny
      * No record of mystical or paramystical activity at Syon or any other women’s house with access to the mystical writings of roughly contemporary Continental women writers
         * See Nicholas Watson “The Composition of Julian of Norwich’s Revelation of Love”


* Carthusians largely responsible for transmitting Continental mysticism to a discrete section of the lay community
* Lollardy offered spiritual independence and self-direction to members of the laity
* Carthusians introduced same kind of privilege normally associated with the contemplative life to a spiritual aristocracy
   * Careful in situating the vernacular texts against Latin works
   * Sensitive to the authorized spiritual needs of their audiences
   * Took care to adapt or modify texts for devotional purposes


* Exercise caution when considering Margaret Deanesly’s claim that “The Life of St. Catherine of Siena” (sometimes confused with The Dialogue) was among the most popular devotional works bequeathed in the 14th and 15th c. (“Vernacular Books in England in the 14th and 15th Cs) MLA Review 15, 1920
   * Undoubtedly -- increased circulation of mystical works like The Dialogue in the 15th c thanks in part to Carthusian influence
   * BUT complex networks of circulation
      * Families with members in religious houses
      * Not indicative of widespread influence
   * Carthusian Patrons with religious devotions in part imitation of Continental ecstatic women including C
      * Cecily, Duchess of York, mother of Edward IV
      * Alianore Roos
      * Elizabeth Sywardby
   * Though imitatio may have included chastity, spiritual tears, contemplative prayer (that is, private practice), did not typically include missionary or even visionary imitatio
   * Reading instead regulated and extended private prayer
      * Did not transform prayer into action, whether apostolic or visionary
   * Gatherings of gentlewomen for reading and prayer in imitation of religious communal life (149)
      * Textual communities
         * See Brian Stock The Implications of Literacy, 1982, pp. 88-92
      * Cecily of York, for example, instructed that she be read writings of St Bridget, Mecthild of Hackeborn or C of S during dinner
         * This would form the conversation later during supper with those present
            * Felicity Riddy, “Women Talking about the Things of God” 1993, ed. Meale
      * Women therefore adhered much to the formulation of reading and devotion outlined in the Prologue to The Orcherd of Syon
   * Nuns and devout gentlewomen undoubtedly inhabited the same closely supervised textual communities and their books circulated accordingly 
      * Dame Mald Wade, prioress of Swyne, gave religious anthology incl writings of C to dame Joan Hyltoft prior to 1482
      * Lady Margaret Beaufort willed to granddaughter Brigitte the life of C of S
      * Sister Elizabeth Stryckland, nun at Syon and original owner of one of three Orcherd copies, died in 1540, book became property of Richard Assheton, executor of her will, who gave the book to his wife -- the book then became the possession of Katherine Sacheverell
   * Visual evidence of Syon’s sponsoring of C
      * Painted screen at Horsham St Faith’s in Norfolk (1528) - St Bridget and St Catherine
      * Cambridge Fitzwilliam MS 48, an Hours of the Virgin called the Carew-Poyntz Hours, folio 85v, depicted enclosed in contemplation (150-1)
         * Books that had female patrons that did retreats at Syon?
      * Wynkyn de Worde’s volume has C alone in one instance and with community of sisters in frontispiece and endpiece
* Improbability of imitative “ecstatic” reading among the owners of the vita or Dialogue in 15th c England, when compared to the kind of imitation that certainly took place in the visionary communities we know of on the Continent in the 13th and 14th centuries
* English mystics of the 14th and 15th century England are primarily problematic figures who negotiate or challenge the strictures of mystical or visionary activity in a religious climate suspicious of religious anomaly or self-promotion
   * Richard Rolle
   * Julian of Norwich
      * Most credibility due to her isolation and deliberate countering of any suspicion of heresy that might arise through incorporated strategies in Revelation of Love
   * Margery Kempe
   * maybe Langland


* Extreme penitence -- fasting, physical discipline & keeping vigil -- was another component of female sanctity 
   * C began these practices after her first vision of Christ at age of six
      * She was unusual in making such rigorous penitence a communal affair
         * By the age of 7, according to Raymond, she gathered other girls of her age “to discipline themselves together with her” and pray
         * Letters to laywomen arguing that Christ’s blood and body were the only really nourishing food
* C’s Dialogue does not include traditionally English hierarchical distinctions evident in Middle English contemplative treatises
   * Distinctly inclusive taxonomy -- to a general audience
      * Vocal / mental prayer
      * Holy tears
      * Ability to discern real from false visions
   * Love can be perfect or imperfect
   * Souls can be worldly or unworldly, ignorant or self-knowing
* C, like other women visionaries, is not above criticizing the clergy, but her condemnation of the in her discussion of mystical union is centered upon their pride as they mistakenly believe that they alone merit illumination
   * She does not privileged those in order for spiritual distinctions (though she has great reverence for the priestly office as is evidenced in her writings)
* Middle English translator felt uncomfortable w bold recognition of mystical illumination as well as C’s invitation to psychic and psychosomatic religious experience
   * Decision to allegorize her colloquies & thus restructure them according to the divine hours is problematic
      * Shift in ordinatio or a reformulation of the rubric is essentially a movement away from if not the original mystical utterance, then at least Raymond’s conceptualization six treatises, thus an editorial move
   * Originally, C’s treatise on “Tears” had its own place in the colloquies
      * Middle English -- appended it to the fourth chapter on “Prayer”
         * Potentially diminishing the importance of tears as a type of holy behavior
         * Placing it as the fifth chapter within “Prayer” section, the translator places it logically behind the sections on false visions, deceitful spiritual comfort, and wicked spirits. 
         * Tears become an essentially private form of prayer according to this reformulation
   * Though the translation is largely faithful, such editorial decisions need to be scrutinized in light of recent research on reception and transmission as literary criticism
* Modifying the text was probably not considered to be tampering with the text at all
   * The translator here does not seem to see a discrepancy btwn C’s injunctions to an active life of charity & his own injunction to serve Our Lady only to read…
   * Even when a text convincingly achieves the univocality of a mystical utterance, w speaker voicing God’s will, translators do not necessarily preserves this “sacred” coherence
      * Adapting these lengthy & often repetitious texts as doctrinal works rather than mystical utterance
         * Compilers felt free to edit, omit, select
         * A revelation could be removed from its context w/o difficulty
   * The translator’s aim is not to encourage mystical experience through dramatic reading, but to provide nuns w small portions of doctrinal food for contemplation and meditation
   * C’s effusive, repetitious, occasionally circular colloquies on the relationship btwn visionary activity and charitable action become cautionary in the English, as opposed to issues of central importance and anxiety 
* Translator in manuscript culture considered needs of his audience, or dictated those needs if his office made him aware of the dangers of unsupervised mystical reading
   * Devotional paternalism, acute in an England experiencing heretical dissension
   * Caxton ignored the vernacular writings of English mystics as risky propositions
   * Both Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde responded to the demands of powerful patrons who did develop a taste for mystical works
   * Excerptor of Margery’s Book, printed by de Worde in 1501, exhibits editorial freedom that strips away the mystical, radical, physical and public aspects of Kempe’s visions
      * Kempe’s voice is diminished
      * Instructional nature of Christ’s colloquies are heightened
      * Implication that Kempe wants martyrdom
      * Nontheatrical form of spirituality -- private, meditative, self-contained, reclusive
   * Conservative nature of English spirituality
      * Good works are not the theatrical imitatio of Italian mendicant spirituality
         * Generous patronage of religious orders
         * Financing of chapels (Margaret, Lady Hungerford, Anne Harling)
         * Service to the parish and community through institutionalized channels
* Margery Kempe
   * Influenced by an earlier Francisca meditative tradition that predisposed her to autobiography
   * Recognized the spiritual dynamism of apostolic living 
   * Understood the relationship between visions and charity
   * Understood the necessity of integrating the active life and the contemplative
   * Writings of and about Continental women and practice of visual meditation no doubt predisposed her toward this synthesis
      * Lack of spiritual models in her daily experience
   * Her Book is noteworthy in that it attempts to reconcile mendicant piety with the new monastic lay piety of 15th c England
      * Failure of reconciliation is not surprising
      * Her contemporaries had a fear of religious experimentation, which is well documented throughout the book
      * See David Wallace, “Mystics and Followers in Siena and East Anglia” 1984 ed Marion Glasscoe
   * Her experience in Italy
      * False friars at home
      * Friar Minor traveled with her to Italy, but an Englishman, gave full and admiring approval
      * Margaret the Florentine
         * Seeks Margery’s prayers
         * Viewed poverty as a sign of sanctity
         * Insisted upon feeding Margery on Sundays and serving her directly
   * In England, she was considered the religious fringe
* Elizabeth Barton
   * 1525, Easter time, servant girl, suffered from acute illness, produced visions, prophetic, confided them too quickly & imprudently (unlike Julian or Margery)
   * Dr Bocking, her confessor, is blamed for exposing her in daily doses to the Revelations  of St Bridget and to C of Siena’s writings
      * Dangerous to the ignorant, may mistakenly imitate or imagine these phenomena
      * Dr Bocking seems to be similar to Raymond after all
* C’s inedia is marveled at by Raymond
   * Penance is more difficult for the English
      * Elizabeth Barton’s urging for fasting is seen as fanatical excess rather than devotion
      * Margery has difficulty with fasting, hairshirts, etc.
   * English devotionalism was impervious to dramatic elements of Continental women’s piety
   * Consider also Marie d’Oignies, whose credibility depended upon charitable works as a response to visions
* The Orcherd translator wished to moderate the use of the visionary work (so it wasn’t taken as literally as Elizabeth Barton took it)
   * Prologue recasts the work for moral and doctrinal instruction
   * Advocates ghostly comfort
   * Subtly discourages pious fantasizing or recreation of ecstatic experience
* English reception -- much work to be done
   * Moved Margery (?) to embrace an apostlic life and record visionary experience
   * Provided others, perhaps wiser women, with a model of contemplative, albeit silent, virtue
