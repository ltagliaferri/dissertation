class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cristofano&rsquo;s translation of Catherine&rsquo;s </span><span class="c14 c12">Dialogo</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;into Latin</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;allowed for the circulation of the text throughout greater Europe, and is the basis for which the initial English translation of Catherine&rsquo;s book was based on (</span><span class="c14">Schultze</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;189). Eventually becoming known as the </span><span class="c14 c12">Orchard of Syon</span><span class="c14">, the text may have been made available as early as 1420, which is also the year that first professions were made at Syon Abbey, five years after the placement of the foundation stone laid by Henry V on February 22, 1415 (Hodgson vii). The desire for a Bridgettine order in England likely began with the marriage between the daughter of King Henry IV, Phillipa, and the King of Sweden, Eric XIII of Pomerania. During her time in Sweden, Phillipa&rsquo;s head lady-in-waiting was the noblewoman Lady Katarina Knutsdotter who was also granddaughter of Bridget of Sweden, and Phillipa served as a benefactor of and frequent guest to Vadstena Abbey, founded by Bridget in 1346 (</span><span class="c14">Flemberg</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;181-92). The Syon Abbey was a project that was as component of Henry V&rsquo;s effort to legitimize his dynasty, and proved to become the most important house for female religious established in England in the century prior to the Reformation. Remarkably, the abbey would survive into the twenty-first century, with the last nuns leaving as recently as 2011. </span></p><p class="c11 c15"><span class="c13">Being the only house in England of the Bridgettines or the Order of St Saviour, which was founded by Bridget of Sweden, it was indicative of the ongoing movement of the time that spoke to renewal and reform in spirituality. It enjoyed great funding by Henry V, took a stand against Henry VIII&rsquo;s project of the Reformation, and helped to develop Catholic recusant identity (Bainbridge 82). The role of Bridget of Sweden to the community should not be overlooked, as she was not a conventional saint, especially for contemporary English devotion at the time which was concerned with Lollardy. Notably serving as a model for the English religious figure Margery Kempe, the noble-born Bridget was not a virgin but instead was a married woman who bore eight children and was widowed following a pilgrimage she took with her husband to Santiago de Compostela. Upon the death of her husband, Bridget joined the Third Order of St. Francis and devoted herself to a life of prayer, caring for the poor and the sick, and developing her community of double monasteries where men and women could live in poverty but still have access to books. Syon itself was originally a doubly monastery, possessing a separate community with separate library each for men and women. We have inherited a large and thorough library catalogue from Syon Abbey that was preserved throughout the community&rsquo;s exile in Lisbon during the post-Reformation. The collection is now housed at the University of Exeter.</span></p><p class="c11 c15"><span class="c14">In addition to Bridget&rsquo;s interest in texts and literacy, community-building, and her status as a tertiary nun, she shared political aspirations with Catherine of Siena, traveling to Rome and working to return the papal seat there from Avignon. Along with being a biological mother, Bridget&rsquo;s spirituality clashed with English religiosity due to her status as a mystic and a non-martyr, important because martyrdom served as the chief criterion for English sanctity from the early Middle Ages through the Reformation (</span><span class="c14">Despres</span><span class="c14">). English devotional practices, especially for women, were very restricted and continental figures that managed to develop a career of public spiritual advocacy and mystical practices would not prove to be suitable models. Though Margery Kempe suffered for her public displays of piety, Julian of Norwich&rsquo;s position as an anchoress allowed her freedom to express her mystical experiences in texts. While 15th-century England does not immediately seem like a fitting environment for a figure like Catherine, not yet canonized, the local situation in the Bridgettine Syon Abbey seems like a more apt context for women to read an English translation of the </span><span class="c14 c12">Dialogo</span><span class="c13">. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a text alone, the </span><span class="c14 c12">Orchard of Syon</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;does not provide much available information and data regarding its provenance or the purpose behind it. Inevitably linked with the Syon Abbey and its nuns, it was likely intended for the first generation of these nuns specifically, and its primary translator was an anonymous one. As C. Annette Gris&eacute; notes, Wynkyn de Worde&rsquo;s printing of the </span><span class="c14 c12">Orcharde of Syon </span><span class="c14">was &ldquo;the first book to showcase its association with Syon and its nuns,&rdquo; with the nuns being addressed directly in the second prologue and epilogue, in addition to woodcuts that are evocative of the female community there (&ldquo;Syon Abbey and English Books,&rdquo; 132). From there, many more books of the &ldquo;Syon tradition&rdquo; would establish references to the abbey among its framing materials, including the works of Richard Whitford in the 1520s and 1530s. </span><span class="c13">The manuscript of this English translation of Catherine&rsquo;s text was found within two copies according to an &ldquo;Envoy,&rdquo; was continued by another by the name of &ldquo;Dan Jamys,&rdquo; who may have been a monk in the Carthusian monastery of Sheen, across the Thames from the female Syon Abbey (Schultze 189). Though in many ways the text is a faithful one, the major changes are editorial in nature, which serve to completely recast Catherine&rsquo;s unique spirituality to one that is more in-line with traditional English expressions of devotion. C. Annette Grise&#769; maintains that &ldquo;framing materials&rdquo;&nbsp;&mdash; prologues, prefatory letters, woodcuts, incipits, explicits and title-pages &mdash; were deployed to establish what amounted to a spiritual provenance within Syon Abbey, leading to substantiating a form of legitimacy on the part of the community (136). </span></p><p class="c11 c15"><span class="c14">Whether or not the prologue added this notion of a source, it is clear that the frame added to the </span><span class="c14 c12">Orchard</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;served to allegorize the original Italian material, thus rendering Catherine&rsquo;s concept of the vineyard and communal vineyards instead into a monastic image of a cloistered garden, and placing a greater emphasis on the &ldquo;ghostly orchard&rdquo; and &ldquo;ghostly learning&rdquo; rather than an active spirituality based on doing good works in the world. In addition to the framing narrative, another editorial intervention occurs that restructures the rubric, moving away from the Italian formulation. In particular, the English version moves the treatise on tears from its own position within the colloquies, to being appended to the fourth chapter on &ldquo;Prayer.&rdquo; Despres contends that this movement decreases the significance of tears in Catherine&rsquo;s devotion and as a holy behavior independent of prayer, situating tears as a private form of worship and a component of praying in general terms (154). Though these interventions may be seemingly slight moves, and in many ways the women of Syon Abbey were still provided with access to the texts that Catherine originally wrote, rendered for them to read in their own vernacular language, the same textual control and attention to Catherine&rsquo;s unique spirituality that were components of her reception in the Italian tradition are not preserved in England. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the editorial changes done by the English translators of Catherine&rsquo;s dialogue suggest a closed-off and more private and contemplative approach to spirituality, the significance of a literate female community engaging with Catherine&rsquo;s texts should not be overlooked. The provenance of a Brigittine monastery certainly points to an interest in literacy, reading and books, and the Syon Abbey exemplifies this tradition with its great output and preservation of texts through the years, even maintaining them while they were exiled in Lisbon. Reading practices within the monastery were not limited to private devotion, and were structured throughout the day in various ways, with reading done silently and out loud with the utilization of printed books and manuscripts, and done both within communal spaces and privately in cells (</span><span class="c14">Bowden</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;187). Of course, the women who would become the nuns and abbesses of Syon Abbey were from an elite class as they were able to read, unlike Margery Kempe who could not read and edit the autobiography she dictated to her scribes. And indeed, these women circulated the books of Syon Abbey with a complex network of female lay patrons. In part due to a Carthusian influence of the 15th century, the laity were able to in part imitate continental ecstatic women, and were also able to intersect with the texts coming out of religious houses due to their having family members placed there. Denise L. Despres names Cecily, Duchess of York and mother of Edward IV; Alianore Roos; and Elizabeth Sywardby as among the female lay patrons who were most interested in reading continental devotional works. Though this should not necessarily suggest an extremely wide readership of Catherine&rsquo;s work in English, the lay patrons who were interested in the textual production at Syon Abbey were likely the reason behind Wynkyn de Worde&rsquo;s 1519 printed edition of the </span><span class="c14 c12">Orchard</span><span class="c13">. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c18 c17">Manuscripts</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two earliest extant manuscripts of Catherine&rsquo;s </span><span class="c14 c12">Dialogo</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;into English date from the first half of the 15th century: British Library MS Harley 3432, and Cambridge, St John&rsquo;s College MS C.25. These first two editions are from the early history of Syon Abbey (Gris&eacute;, </span><span class="c14 c12">Syon Abbey in Late Medieval England</span><span class="c13">, 50). The third extant manuscript is from the second half of the 15th century, Morgan M 162. There are additionally two manuscripts that contain a portion of the translation: an extract of part I, chapter 12 in Manchester, John Rylands Library, MS Latin 395; and an extract of part V, chapter 2 in Oxford, University College, MS 14 (Schultze 190). </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though these manuscripts are named for the Abbey, and though there is evidence that this text was read by the women there, and though Catherine of Siena was an important female figure worshiped alongside the Virgin and Bridget of Sweden, &ldquo;there is a conspicuous absence of evidence of manuscript production in the great women&rsquo;s religious houses in England,&rdquo; at Syon or any other women&rsquo;s religious house (such as Barking, Dartford, Shaftsbury, Denny) (Despres 147). Ian Doyle writes that while many cloistered women did not enjoy literacy, women belonging to prestigious religious houses owned &ldquo;a good many books, both for prayer and for reading, in French and English, besides for worship in Latin, and there is no reason why some anonymous manuscripts from the better-educated houses &hellip; should not have been written, decorated and bound by them&rdquo; (</span><span class="c14">15</span><span class="c14">). Therefore, though there is a clear connection between the Syon Abbey and its readership and ownership of the </span><span class="c14 c12">Orcherd of Syon</span><span class="c13">, there is no concrete documentation that links the production of any of these manuscripts to the women or the Abbey outright.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earliest extant manuscript, the British Library&rsquo;s Harley 3432 includes an incipit by an anonymous cleric who was most likely Carthusian, addressed to the &ldquo;Religyuos moder &amp; deuoute sustren, clepid &amp; chosen bisily to laboure at the hous of Syon,&rdquo; positioning this book within the context of the Abbey in an immediate way. This manuscript is exquisitely decorated, particularly at its celtic-knot initials with red, blue, green and white ink, and gold leaf, though some initials are left unfinished. For each new part, there is an emphasis on the border around the two columns of text, setting the structural parts off as discrete units. There is every indication that more decoration was intended for this manuscript as there are light marks in the rulings of many pages; good examples of this can be seen on pages 77r, 103v, 104r, 137r, 139r, and 174v.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13">Drawing of person in between two columns on 122v (male face in profile -- there is a reference to &ldquo;poor men&rdquo; in the text nearby). Most of the marginalia present seems to have been done by the original hand, in the form of citations or lengthy additions that replace cross-outs of the text in columns (as on 117r). Some marginalia includes decoration, including a drawing of a male face in profile between the columns on 122v &mdash; there is a reference to &ldquo;poor men&rdquo; in the proximate text.</span></p><p class="c11 c15"><span class="c13">There is also the marginalia of others in the book, including historically much more recent lightly done marginalia on 105r. At the beginning and last pages of the book there are many male autographs from the 16th and 17th centuries, showing clearly that this book continued to be seen as a luxury item, if not a text to read, throughout its life before its inclusion in the British Library. The material nature of the book reveals that there has been continued care, as some pages that were ripped were repaired with new vellum paper (not animal hide), as can be seen on pages 45, 50, 107 (small tear), 119, small repairs on 127 and 128, and on page 148. Some pages are ripped and repaired with new vellum (not animal hide), which can be seen on pages 21, 45, 50, slightly on 107, 119, small repairs on 127 &amp; 128, 148. In the instance of page 21, it is possible to see that someone re-wrote the missing letters on the new vellum, which appears to have been added on the recto but transparent enough to see through to the verso. Though this repair was done with care it is an obvious remedy due to the use of much later paper. Despite this commitment to tending to the book, there is what appears to be a spill over some pages, particularly along the top, with pages 172-174 and 182-193 most damaged. These spills do not diminish the legibility, and instead suggest a continued engagement with the text beyond the book as a collectible. </span></p><p class="c11 c15"><span class="c13">Among the signatures in the front and back of the book is one from Walter D&rsquo;evereux, the 1st Devereux Earl of Essex. This became a book within John Batteley&rsquo;s collection, who was a Church of England clergyman and antiquary. The Harley Collection purchased Batteley&rsquo;s collection on November 5, 1723 (Wright 1966). Formed by Robert, Mortimer and Edward Harley, the Collection was bequeathed to Edward Harley&rsquo;s widow Henrietta Cavendish, then to their daughter Margaret Cavendish Bentinck, and was eventually sold to the nation of England in 1753, forming one of the foundation collections of the British Library. The lifecycle of the manuscript points primarily to masculine readership or at least ownership through the 16th and 17th centuries, and eventually returns to female ownership before becoming part of a communal reading space more in line with its provenance. </span></p><p class="c21"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 417.75px; height: 501.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image00.png" style="width: 455.73px; height: 528.55px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -13.89px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c14 c16"><a class="c25" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMINBig.ASP?size%3Dbig%26IllID%3D24730&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1486450433647000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7QWrcZD_LqApqNNj8msc4nw9k5A">http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMINBig.ASP?size=big&amp;IllID=24730</a></span><span class="c13">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cambridge, St John&rsquo;s College MS C.25 is in a much different style to the Harley MS, with plainer decoration and the vellum is smaller in size. Initials have some decoration in red and blue ink and include gold leaf, though initials were cut out in two instances, and the first three pages of the manuscript are no longer extant. There is some sketched floral decoration in black ink in the margins, as well as banner illustrations to show continuing text to aid those who would sew the pages together. There is some marginalia that highlights text with lines and curves, including playful marginalia that turns the curves into a face on 54r. There is light textual marginalia written in Latin on several pages. The ink of this text is very faint, and it appears that it could be in the original scribal hand, though this cannot be certain and may instead point to another contemporary reader. In either case, this marginalia indicates that there is some educated readership engaging with this manuscript that itself has been the result of intertextuality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c19">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c18 c19"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Morgan Library</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">MS M.162</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">B1 350 C MS M.0162</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(ca. 1470)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Orchard of Syon</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">186 leaves (1 column, 36 lines), bound:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">210 x 140 mm</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bound ms.

Although Catherine&rsquo;s Italian Dialogo was written for a general audience, the text was translated into English with the intended readership of the nuns of the Bridgettine Syon Abbey. Because the English translation utilized Raymond of Capua&rsquo;s Latin translation of the text, the use of Latin as an intermediary language will be considered, as well as the gendered implications of a male rewriting the words of the female author for female readers. With an emphasis on the connections between Italian and English reception, as well as how expressions of spirituality were translated from the continent to England, this paper concludes with an examination of Catherine&rsquo;s construction as a teacher of religious women.</span></p><p class="c11 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this chapter will examine Catherine&rsquo;s legacy within historical themes, in both Pre-Protestant and Post-Protestant England, I will divide it into two parts. The first section will analyze the Middle English translation of the Dialogo into the Orcherd of Syon for the cloistered Bridgettine Syon Abbey, and consider the text in relation to the history of the book and the gendered expectations of religious women in England. Secondly, I will analyze how the text of Stefano of Siena&rsquo;s letter addressed to a Dominican priest represents Catherine as a maternal figure to Carthusian monks in England and the Sheen Charterhouse, and why this is of significance in terms of religious community-building. Lastly, this chapter will explore Catherine as a mystical literary figure in contrast to the mystical literary production of English religious women Margery Kempe and Julian of Norwich.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second section of this chapter will speak to the changing religious landscape in England as it shifts to Protestantism. The major text of this section is John Fenn&rsquo;s 1609 translation of the Life of Catherine for English recusants, in contrast with both Raymond&rsquo;s original version and Wynken de Worde&rsquo;s 1492 English edition. Here, this chapter will investigate the cultural climate and how that influences the construction and reception of a literary Italian saint.</span></p><p class="c11 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13">Women&rsquo;s engagement with Catherine&rsquo;s writing can be a little more difficult to analyze than men&rsquo;s engagement with her writing, as we have written hagiographies on Catherine that discuss Catherine&rsquo;s literary activity (Caffarini in particular is committed to Catherine&rsquo;s textual production). There is suggestion that women did engage with her writing by the existence of more than one letter to the same woman, and the notion that Catherine did good works with those in her famiglia. In England, we have records of women bequeathing books containing Catherine&rsquo;s writing to other women (in some cases from religious orders to family members outside orders) &mdash; nuns and devout gentlewomen being the most likely to be in possession of &mdash; or with access to &mdash; Catherine&rsquo;s works. The English text of the Dialogue was adapted with a cloistered female readership in mind, as the translator&rsquo;s introduction refocuses the text as a walled garden alluding to the cell of self-knowledge. In this way, Catherine&rsquo;s many references to the vita activa are rendered allegorical. Within the canon of contemporary women writers, we see reference to Catherine in Margery Kempe&rsquo;s Book, and we often see her listed in the catalogues of famous and virtuous women listed and profiled in proto-feminist texts like Marie de Gournay&rsquo;s The Equality of Men and Women. Though she is considerably later, Lucrezia Marinella&rsquo;s engagement with Catherine&rsquo;s texts are the most interesting for me, with two sonnets and a heroic hagiography showing a literary continuity between the two women.</span></p><p class="c11 c3"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with Teresa of Avila, Catherine of Siena became a Doctor of the Church in 1970 (Teresa was honored first in September, and Catherine in October), by Pope Paul VI. The two of them are the first two female Doctors, and there currently are four. &nbsp;Having died in 1380, Catherine was canonized in 1461 by Pope Pius II. For Catherine, I believe that the situating of her as a saint within Latin texts was very important for her eligibility to receive the honors presented to her by the Church. Naming her as Doctor of the Church is a testament to her balance of the contemplative and active life, as Church Doctors are known for their deep religious knowledge and their preaching.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether mysticism or her good works are more important in terms of her reception &mdash; throughout the Renaissance and by scholars and the Church today &mdash; is a more complicated consideration. Suzanne Noffke refers to Catherine as a &ldquo;mystic activist&rdquo; and I am inclined to agree that this is a more apt descriptor than &ldquo;social mystic.&rdquo; If Catherine had remained in her father&rsquo;s house as a recluse, as she did in her earlier spiritual years, we would not have Catherine as a Church Doctor today, but it is exactly this interiority that is emphasized in the Middle English texts. Still, an Englishwoman like Margery Kempe, though she would only have had access to the English translation of the Dialogo, was well aware of Catherine&rsquo;s concern with worldly affairs, and her and other active continental women seemed to influence Margery&rsquo;s pilgrimages and public spiritual activity. The Renaissance reception in general does seem to be hinged on the dual-nature of Catherine&rsquo;s spiritual mission &mdash; had Catherine been a closed-off mystic she would not have received the attention that she did and would not be considered so remarkable, especially today when scholars are well aware of the hurdles Catherine faced compared to her contemporaries.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c13">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">Brown, Jennifer N. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">&ldquo;From the Charterhouse to the Printing House: Catherine of Siena in Medieval England,&rdquo; 2013</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c2 lst-kix_rkwv6vof41on-0 start"><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">Considers Catherine&rsquo;s texts in England from the late 14th to early 17th c</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">3 Middle English Catherine texts</span></li></ul><ul class="c2 lst-kix_rkwv6vof41on-1 start"><li class="c1 c8"><span class="c10">The Orcherd of Syon</span></li></ul><ul class="c2 lst-kix_rkwv6vof41on-2 start"><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Translated and adapted from Italian for the nuns of Syon</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Catherine&rsquo;s visions were probably never intended for a lay audience</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">1519 printing</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Designed for nuns and maybe an elite readership connected to Syon</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">de Worde had access to manuscript versions of this text that do not survive, as he includes the prologue</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Four times removed from its original</span></li></ul><ul class="c2 lst-kix_rkwv6vof41on-3 start"><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">Printed edition of a translation (Middle English) of a translation (Latin) of a dictated text (Italian)</span></li></ul><ul class="c2 lst-kix_rkwv6vof41on-2"><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Widest dissemination, and the most studied of Catherine&rsquo;s English tradition</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Catherine&rsquo;s Dialogue had been structured by her scribes, the Middle English translator more or less adheres to this order, but prefaces the translation with a lengthy introduction about how the book should be read and for whom it is intended</span></li></ul><ul class="c2 lst-kix_rkwv6vof41on-3 start"><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">The translator must have been witness to much gardening due to his knowledge (p. 34)</span></li></ul><ul class="c2 lst-kix_rkwv6vof41on-2"><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Meditative, mystical text that resonates with Bridget&rsquo;s own revelations</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Margery Kempe may have known the text -- visited Syon Abbey</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Translator has adapted C&rsquo;s understanding of both service and prayer to the cloistered life of the Syon nuns</span></li></ul><ul class="c2 lst-kix_rkwv6vof41on-1"><li class="c1 c8"><span>Raymond of Capua&rsquo;s </span><span class="c12">Vita </span><span>/ </span><span class="c12">Lyf</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></li></ul><ul class="c2 lst-kix_rkwv6vof41on-2 start"><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Translator&rsquo;s prologue is familiar and addresses a specific audience</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">The text is edited so that it does not surpass the reader&rsquo;s understanding but rather speaks to those things that longeth only to one&rsquo;s learning</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Circulated outside of the convent and charterhouse</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Puts C forth as an exemplary model of female devotion and sanctity</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span>Translator does not maintain the first person singular but will call the &ldquo;I&rdquo; as &ldquo;Raymond&rdquo; -- this is unlike many translations of </span><span class="c12">vitae</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and other devotional texts of the same period</span></li><li class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">Probably most suited for a lay audience</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c22">The Medieval Mystical Tradition in England: Exeter Symposium VII</span><span class="c9">, 2004</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c2 lst-kix_av0p6tmrzb6f-0 start"><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">C. Annette Gris&eacute; sees the early appearance in print of original and translated mystical writings as regularly simplifying their originals; she notes a &quot;shift towards a more didactic focus&quot; and a favoring of shorter works &quot;more suitable for a general devout audience&quot; (p. 83). Mystical writing by holy women is generally played down in favor of &quot;lives, extracts and prayers&quot; offering holy examples to their readers. Gris&eacute; notes the probable importance of Syon as suppliers of religious material to the printers. Two full-length works commissioned by Syon, The Orcherde of Syon and The Myroure of Oure Ladye, may appear to buck the prevailing trend of short didactic works, but the contrast is, Gris&eacute; insists, more apparent than real: in particular, the readership of the Myroure was probably confined to professed religious, though since it provides a complete translation of the Birgittine Office it might just about be available for use by pious layfolk (cf. p. 88 n. 24) as a devotional exercise. </span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span>David Griffith shows us a different form of dilution, one partly explained by the form chosen for the material, panel painting?images of Sts Catherine of Siena, Birgitta of Sweden, and Elizabeth of Hungary?in parish churches in East Anglia and Devon.
