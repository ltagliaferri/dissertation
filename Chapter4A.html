Though one may expect monetary analogies to be most effective with a lay and noble audience, Catherine also employs economic metaphors when writing letters addressed to religious recipients. As Catherine and her contemporaries were living during a time when the mercantile class was flourishing, trade was increasing, and written language was becoming more accessible to the general population (i.e., the rise of the vernacular in Europe), commercial and monetary concerns touched a greater portion of society. This blending of the spiritual and the earthly shows a careful negotiation of mixed signs that can at times seem contradictory, especially as Catherine&rsquo;s teachings encourage poverty. The letters to nobles in particular must achieve a prudent balance in an effort to be complimentary to those who are likely providing some financial or political support to herself, and theological teachings that favor poverty over riches. </span></p><p class="c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 512.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image00.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 512.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In 39 letters, 15 of which were written to women, Catherine uses the economic metaphor o</span><span class="c0">f &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;a word that Catherine also uses in the </span><span class="c0 c14">Dialogo</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;and which Suzanne Noffke explains &ldquo;has the sense of a down payment, a pledge of future payment in full&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0 c14">The Dialogue</span><span class="c0">, 68). The 1612 edition of the </span><span class="c0 c14">Vocabolario dell&rsquo;Accademia della Crusca</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Venezia) provides the following definition for the word </span><span class="c0 c14">arra</span><span class="c0">: &ldquo;propriamente parte di pagamento della mercatantia pattuita, che si da al creditore per sicurt&agrave;, laquale, in caso, la mercatantia non si volesse, si perde.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The word therefore has a sense of a deposit, a payment installment, or a guarantee that the item will be paid in full at a future point in time. In her letters, Catherine uses the phrases &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra d&rsquo;inferno&rdquo; (&ldquo;down payment on hell&rdquo;) and &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna,&rdquo; (&ldquo;down payment on the eternal life&rdquo;) most frequently, with just &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra&rdquo; used twice and &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra della morte eternale&rdquo; used once to Raymond.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;In the chart above, we can see that she uses the phrase &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna&rdquo; most often for male religious, and more so for men than for women throughout each class (religious, noble, and lay), respectively. Women were far more likely to receive the phrase &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra d&rsquo;inferno,&rdquo; except for in the case of female religious. Catherine is therefore much more likely to tell women that they are making a down payment on hell while telling men that they are making a down payment on the eternal life in paradise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Striking a parallel between financial language and spiritual matters is not original, but Catherine uses this analogy frequently. The Latin Vulgate version (the one Catherine would have been familiar with) of the Epistle to the Ephesians (the tenth book of the New Testament) includes the passage </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;qui est pignus hereditatis nostrae in redemptionem adquisitionis in laudem gloriae ipsius&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">(Ephesians 1:14)</span><span class="c0">.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Both &ldquo;pignus&rdquo; and &ldquo;adquisitionis&rdquo; have economic connotations, with &ldquo;pignus&rdquo; referring to a pledge (or security for debt) or a mortgage, and &ldquo;adquisitionis&rdquo; referring to an acquisition.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Following the canonical text of the Bible ensures that Catherine is not using language that is far removed from tradition, which could serve to protect her as a woman writing about spiritual matters. As neither of the Latin words used in Ephesians are a cognate for &ldquo;arra,&rdquo; it is worth noting that Dante does use this word in </span><span class="c0 c14">Purgatorio</span><span class="c0">: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Lo sommo Ben, che solo esso a s&eacute; piace, / f&eacute; l&rsquo;uom buono e a bene, e questo loco / diede per </span><span class="c12">arr&rsquo; a lui d&rsquo;etterna pace</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; (28, 91-93, emphasis mine).</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Dante uses this language in the passage narrated by Matilda in the earthly paradise, where she gives the historical context of Eden and explains that &ldquo;the high Good&rdquo; paid a down payment to man for eternal peace. Even predating Dante, is the work of female mystic Angela da Foligno, whose Latin text, often referred to as her &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c14">Libro</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; (as with Catherine&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c14">Dialogo</span><span class="c7 c0">), also uses the word &ldquo;arra:&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Studeamus igitur sustinere tribulationes temporales cum patientia, immo &amp; cum gaudio. In eis enim signum recipimus, quod sumus dilecti &amp; electi ab amato, &amp; </span><span class="c12">recipimus arram suae haereditatis</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Angela da Foligno,</span><span class="c0 c14">&nbsp;Angela de Fulginio</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;390, emphasis mine).</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c0">Angela is directly referring to the Epistle to the Ephesians, which may indicate that in oral language people were substituting the word &ldquo;arra&rdquo; for &ldquo;pignus&rdquo; in 13th- and 14th-century Italy. Even if this were not the case, the use of the common word of &ldquo;arra&rdquo; suggests again that there is an exchange between mystical and poetic writing, as writers in both genres are using this specific financial word to write about spirituality. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c0">In one of Catherine&rsquo;s letters to Don Giovanni dalle Celle, a Vallombrosan whom she met at his hermitage outside Florence in 1374, she explains that those who are full of love for God taste the down payment they make on the eternal life, while those who direct love to themselves taste the deposit they make on hell (T322):</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Non gli &egrave; duro il portare pena n&egrave; fadiga; anco gli &egrave; diletto, perch&egrave; con odio santo ha abbandonato s&egrave; medesimo, onde riluce in lui la virt&ugrave; della pazienza, con le sue sorelle, cio&egrave; fortezza e longa perseveranzia. Questi gusta l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna: siccome quegli che stanno nell&#39;amore proprio,gustano l&rsquo;arra dell&#39;inferno; perch&egrave; sono fatti incomportabili a loro medesimi, amando disordinatamente s&egrave; e le creature e le cose create.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c0">The letter, believed to be dated shortly after December 13, 1378, is the second letter she has addressed to Don Giovanni dalle Celle, and in it, she encourages him to follow through to be present at the council of the servants of God that Urban VI had invited him to join in Rome. The letter deals with the theme of charity, which she refers to as a &ldquo;dolce madre&rdquo; (&ldquo;sweet mother&rdquo;), and she explains that she is sure that if his love were to be consumed in the oven of divine charity he will certainly leave behind his selfish love, but she constructs her letter to suggest that his responding positively to the invitation from the pope is a kind of test of this love:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Or m&rsquo;avvedr&ograve; se voi sarete amatori di Dio e della reformazione di santa Chiesa, e se voi non ragguarderete alle proprie consolazioni. Son certa che, se voi averete consumato l&#39;amore proprio in questa fornace, voi non curerete d&rsquo;abbandonare la cella e le vostre consolazioni; ma piglierete la cella del cognoscimento di voi, e con essa verrete a ponere la vita, se bisogner&agrave;, per la verit&agrave; dolce. Altrimenti, no. E per&ograve; vi dissi ch&rsquo;io desideravo di vedere consumato ogni amore proprio di voi nella fornace della divina carit&agrave;.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">As one of her &ldquo;staunchest defenders,&rdquo; Don Giovanni dalle Celle was likely living a life consistent with what Catherine describes as being a lover of God, but in this letter she is setting out to ensure that he will dedicate himself to reform the Church (Noffke, </span><span class="c0 c14">Letters</span><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;Vol. IV, 35). By setting up the financial dichotomy between those who direct their love towards God in the act of divine charity, and those who direct their love inwards towards selfish comforts, Catherine is able to emphasize that these choices serve as deposits on the eternal life.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a series of letters Catherine uses variations on the theme of the down payment, which seems to be indicative of the spiritual growth of the addressee. Serving as a patron and disciple to Catherine, Ristoro di Piero Canigiani was a learned lawyer as well as a leading Guelf in Florence. The son of Piero Canigiani and older brother of Barduccio, he acted in a political capacity on behalf of Florence in dealings with Queen Giovanna of Naples and Gregory XI. Catherine first writes to support him through the Revolt of the Ciompi, a rebellion of unrepresented laborers that began in Florence in 1378. The houses of prominent Guelfs &mdash; considered to be enemies of the people &mdash; were looted and burned around June 22, 1378, and his house and his father&rsquo;s were among those that were damaged. His father was also exiled from the city. Catherine does not explicitly mention these events in her first letter to Ristoro, T299, but mentions a tragic event in his life, causing Noffke to date this to July 1378 (</span><span class="c0 c14">Letters</span><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;III, 160). In this letter, she discusses how loving material goods is problematic, because those are only loaned to us, and we will be parted with those goods either during life (when God wills it), or when we die. If people love with sensual love, and with love of the world and its pleasures, people make down payments on hell, as she mentions twice in this single letter:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Questo &egrave; quello miserabile amore che tolle il lume della ragione, e non lassa cognoscere la verit&agrave;; tolle la vita della Grazia, e dacci la morte; tolleci la libert&agrave;, e facciservi e schiavi del peccato, che &egrave; quella cosa che non &egrave;: onde in questa vita gusta l&rsquo;arra dell&rsquo;inferno.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c0">...</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Egli &egrave; fatto incomportabile a s&egrave; medesimo: onde gusta l&rsquo;arra dell&rsquo;inferno; per&ograve; che il vermine della coscienzia sempre rode. </span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">What is significant in these instances is that Catherine contextualizes the love of money and possessions with the idea of a down payment, striking a very apt parallel that can prove to be effective for those in the noble class, especially at a time when those in Florence are suffering from having lost many of their earthly possessions. Catherine&rsquo;s letter continues to explain that the love of God, which can be manifested in acts of charity, is a love that cannot be taken away as sensual love can. She writes, &ldquo;E per&ograve; questi cotali di neuna cosa possono avere pena, perocch&egrave; hanno posto l&rsquo;amore e l&rsquo;affetto in quella cosa che non gli pu&ograve; essere tolta,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;insisting that those who order their lives around God &mdash; acting with integrity in marriage, raising children to love God, and doing works of charity &mdash; will suffer no pain because love and affection cannot be taken away from them.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the next letter addressed to him (T258), it is clear that Catherine had received a letter from Ristoro in which he described his commitment to reforming his life. She responded some time prior to August 10, &ldquo;when the lifting of the interdict was publicly proclaimed in Florence&rdquo; (Noffle </span><span class="c0 c14">Letters</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;III 170). In this letter, Catherine discusses her happiness to see his &ldquo;santo desiderio&rdquo; (&ldquo;holy desire&rdquo;), explaining that his effort to forgive those who had wronged him will ensure that he lives in grace and peace. Those who live in hatred, however, &ldquo;&egrave; privato di Dio, e sta in stato di dannazione; e in questa vita gusta l&rsquo;arra dell&rsquo;inferno: perocch&egrave; sempre si rode in s&egrave; medesimo, e appetisce vendetta, e sta sempre con timore.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c0 c7">&nbsp;Again, there is the worldly image of making a deposit on the infernal afterlife through hatred, revenge, and fear. As the analogy had worked effectively in letter T299, Catherine uses it again, urging the noble Ristoro to continue to redirect his devotion to temporal possessions towards God instead. Catherine&rsquo;s letter moves on to advise him to unburden his conscience of whatever he thinks is weighing it down, offering him concrete actionable tasks that she enumerates for his benefit. The fourth item that Catherine advises Ristoro on is his marriage:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Aggiungoci una cosa: che nello stato del matrimonio voi stiate con timore di Dio, e con riverenzia v&rsquo;andiate come a sacramento, e non con disordinato desiderio. E i d&igrave; che sono comandati dalla santa Chiesa, abbiate in debita riverenzia, siccome uomo ragionevole, e non come animale bruto. Allora di voi e di lei, siccome arbori buoni, producerete buoni frutti.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c0">Despite her lack of earthly experience in the domain of human marriage, Catherine is able to offer advice on best practices, revealing her adeptness at being aware of her audience and constructing spiritual paths that are attainable across personal circumstances.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In T301, her last letter to Ristoro, which Noffke dates later than T279 to mid-November 1378, Catherine implies that the recipient and his wife are earnestly considering the abstinence she had recommended in previous letters (</span><span class="c0 c14">Letters</span><span class="c0">, Vol. III, 332). Catherine is very happy for his commitment to spiritual love, and as she wants to see him continue to grow in &ldquo;il lume e la virt&ugrave;&rdquo; (&ldquo;light and virtue&rdquo;), she tells him to focus on a few things. Again, these are very task-oriented, providing Ristoro with particular actions to carry out. As part of contextualizing the list as well as encouraging him to follow a virtuous path, she writes, &ldquo;La virt&ugrave; gli &egrave; tanto piacevole, che dell&rsquo;uomo virtuoso egli ne fa un altro s&egrave; per affetto dolce d&rsquo;amore; e in questa vita gli fa gustare l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna: che stando nel mare tempestoso delle molte fadighe e amaritudini, gusta la pace e la dolcezza.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;In this letter there is a shift from a down payment on hell to a deposit or a pledge of eternal life. Catherine&rsquo;s letters to Ristoro reveal a trajectory towards spiritual growth including some kind of virtuous spiritual attainment through Catherine&rsquo;s financial knowledge that moves the recipient as paying down for a place in Hell to securing a position in Paradise instead. However, rather than Ristoro pledging money on eternal life, it seems more likely in this context that in return for virtuosity, God is offering a backed pledge on the eternal life to Ristoro, such that he can taste peace and sweetness during his time on Earth through doing good in the world. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, people on Earth are not the only ones engaging in financial exchanges, as Catherine explicitly discusses Christ&rsquo;s making a financial pledge to his followers in a letter to the Queen of Naples, Giovanna d&rsquo;Angi&ograve; (T143). By adding the verb &ldquo;pagare&rdquo; (&ldquo;to pay&rdquo;) alongside &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra,&rdquo; Catherine makes the monetary image even more explicit. She writes:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">O dolcissimo amore Ges&ugrave;, in segno che tu l&rsquo;avevi presa per sposa, in capo degli otto d&igrave; tu le donasti l&rsquo;anello della dolcissima e santissima mano tua, nel tempo della santa Circoncisione. Cos&igrave; sapete voi, venerabile madre mia, che in capo degli otto d&igrave;, se silev&ograve; tanta carne quanta &egrave; un cerchio d&#39;anello, e cominci&ograve; a pagarci l&rsquo;arra, per darci pienamente speranza del pagamento, il quale ricevemmo in su &lsquo;l legno della santissima croce, quando questo sposo, Agnello immacolato, fu svenato, e da ogni parte vers&ograve; abbondanzia di sangue col quale lav&ograve; le immondizie e peccati della sposa sua, cio&egrave; l&rsquo;umana generazione.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Catherine&rsquo;s imagery of Christ&rsquo;s circumcision is unique to her, though Dupr&eacute; Theseider suggests that there may be a basis for it in Exodus 4, 25-26 (n. 4).</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;In comparing Christ&rsquo;s foreskin to a ring, she is giving it earthly value. In other letters in which she describes Christ&rsquo;s foreskin to a ring given to his followers, she provides additional details </span><span class="c0 c14">in abstentia</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for the ring: it is neither gold nor silver.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Christ&rsquo;s foreskin being implicitly likened to precious metals provides added financial value to the ring, yet Catherine emphasizes that the foreskin is worth so much more, as it is made of Christ&rsquo;s flesh and indicative of his first pain, that it is even better than a monetary pledge of the crucifixion to come. As Caroline Walker Bynum notes, &ldquo;But Catherine herself, in letter after letter, says we do not marry Christ with gold or silver but with the ring of Christ&rsquo;s foreskin, given in the Circumcision and accompanied by pain and the shedding of blood &hellip; shed for the sake of the world&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0 c14">Holy Feast, Holy Fast</span><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;175). The blood and flesh shed during Christ&rsquo;s circumcision are a small sacrifice that show Christ&rsquo;s commitment to his followers, and is the first payment he makes to them. Eventually, he pays for all of their sins in full through his crucifixion, inviting them all to the wedding feast that they will find in Paradise.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imagery of the wedding is canonical in Christian writing, but it brings with it additional layers of earthly and financial imagery. Following the excerpt quoted above in T143 to Giovannad&rsquo;Angi&ograve;, the letter continues:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">E attendete, che il fuoco della divina Carit&agrave; ci ha donato l&rsquo;anello non d&rsquo;oro, ma della purissima carne sua; e hacci fatte le nozze, questo dolcissimo Padre, non di carne d&rsquo;animale, ma del prezioso corpo suo: ed &egrave; questo cibo e Agnello arrostito al fuoco della Carit&agrave; in su il legno della dolce croce. Adunque io vi prego dolcissimamente in Cristo Ges&ugrave;, che il cuore e l&rsquo;anima con ogni suo affetto e movimento e sollecitudine si levi ad amare e a servire s&igrave; dolce e caropadre e sposo quanto &egrave; Dio, somma e eterna Verit&agrave;, quale ci am&ograve; veramente, e senza essere amato.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">As in other letters, the ring here is described as being more valuable than gold, and the feast of the wedding is a feast on the body of Christ. The flame that cooks the flesh is the fire of </span><span class="c0 c14">caritas</span><span class="c0">, and the wood on which it is cooked is that of the cross. All of the material goods of the wedding are brought by God, including the ring and the banquet, and love is paid to the followers of God with no expectation of reciprocation, though Catherine urges followers to love and serve. Paying for a wedding, and paying a dowry (though Christ is typically depicted as the bridegroom rather than the bride), are all financial circumstances that Catherine&rsquo;s contemporaries would have understood. They would also understand faithfulness as an integral component of marriage, which Catherine goes onto describe later in the letter: &ldquo;prima che romper la fede allo Sposo eterno suo.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;Catherine&rsquo;s letters explain to their recipients that Christ makes a down payment with his circumcision and a full payment with his crucifixion to ensure that his followers can live an eternal life, but it is necessary that his followers do not counter this payment with their own payments on hell instead.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Christ has made a full payment on the eternal life for the sake of his followers, all are indebted to him. To capture the significance of what Christians owe to God, Catherine uses the language of being in debt, and of sinners as being debtors (and indeed, all humans are sinners to some degree). This symbolism is used in chapter 25 of her </span><span class="c0 c14">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">, where she asks why he is so merciful: &ldquo;Chi ti muove a fare tanta misericordia? L&rsquo;amore; non </span><span class="c12">il debito</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;o il bisogno che tu abbia di noi, poich&eacute; noi siamo rei e malvagi </span><span class="c12">debitori</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; (emphasis mine).</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;The answer that it is love that compels God to be so merciful to his followers, as he has no real need of the wicked debtors. Catherine uses the word &ldquo;debito&rdquo; in 101 of her letters, about 26% of her extant letters. Indebtedness, and its intersections with broader economic language, is an important aspect of Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality, and throughout her corpus of letters, she uses the symbolism in a different manner. &nbsp;To exemplify her varied approaches, we will consider three letters in particular, one to Niccol&ograve; Soderini, one to an unnamed homosexual, and one to the Defenders of the People and the City of Florence. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noffke dates letter T171 to late February 1376, when Niccol&ograve; di Ruggero (Geri) Soderini was one of the </span><span class="c0 c14">priori delle Arti</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in Florence (Noffke,</span><span class="c0 c14">&nbsp;Letters</span><span class="c7 c0">, Vol. II, 22). It is likely that Soderini had become Catherine&rsquo;s friend and disciple during her 1374 stay in Florence, and we have three letters in total written to him (T131 was dated earlier, and T247 later). In addition to focusing on the idea of indebtedness, this letter also takes up the words &ldquo;legare&rdquo; (to bind), &ldquo;lega&rdquo; (league), and &ldquo;legame&rdquo; (bond), suggestive of Florence&rsquo;s intention to join the antipapal league which was not formalized until July 24th of that year. Throughout this letter, Catherine makes use of several themes and word plays, showing her ability to imbue her letters with complicated and intertwined messages. In this letter, the language around indebtedness likens the relationship between Christians and God to the relationship between a son and his father. The son is forever indebted to his father for having been made of his flesh, and for having been given this flesh without having asked. She writes:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">O non pu&ograve; mai offenderlo (n&eacute; debbe offendere) che non sia in pericolo di morte, e in stato di dannazione. Egli &egrave; sempre debitore a lui, per l&rsquo;essere che gli ha dato: e non preg&ograve; mai il figliuolo il padre, che gli desse della sustanzia della carne sua; nondimeno il padre, mosso per l&rsquo;amore ch&#39;egli ha al figliuolo prima ch&rsquo;egli abbia l&rsquo;essere, gliel d&agrave;. Oh quanto maggiormente noi ignoranti ingrati sconoscenti figliuoli possiamo patire di offendere il nostro vero Padre! Conciossiacosach&eacute; ci abbia amati senza essere amato; perocch&eacute; per amore ci cre&ograve; e anco ci ricre&ograve; a Grazia nel sangue suo &hellip; e tutto ci ha dato per grazia, e non per debito.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">As the son should never offend the father, Christians should never offend God, indeed it would be considered a worse transgression, and is viewed as pursuing death for having flagrantly gone against the one who granted life. Catherine is also incredibly clear in her analogy, not only does she refer to &ldquo;vero Padre&rdquo; in the quote above, but earlier in the letter she also writes, &ldquo;Adunque con sollicitudine d&rsquo;andare a dimandare l&rsquo;adiutorio del Padre, cio&egrave; di Dio, conviencelo addimandare.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;Other imagery in the letter calls to mind Dante&rsquo;s schismatics of Canto 28, as she discusses cutting and joining, conflating their schism-inducing behavior of considering to join the antipapal league with the financial trope of being indebt and not making the appropriate payments, as though being in debt cuts one off from the greater whole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Letter T21, dated to between February and April 1376, and believed to have been written during Holy Week (April 6-11), is written to a man who is described as having engaged in homosexual acts, whom she addresses in the formal </span><span class="c0 c14">voi</span><span class="c0">, and whose name has since been scratched out. Noffke notes that the rubric reveals that here is a place where the copyist deliberately removed the name of the recipient, and also omitted &ldquo;some words unfitting for anyone to know,&rdquo; which Noffke posits to be &ldquo;something Catherine regarded as even worse than homosexual behavior&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c0 c14">Letters</span><span class="c0">, Vol. II, 144). Using similar language to the down payment, but instead constructing it as a debt, she uses variations of the word </span><span class="c0 c14">debito</span><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;11 times throughout this 1,400-word letter. In the first few lines alone she writes the word five times (emphasis mine):</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">...scrivo a voi nel prezioso sangue suo; con desiderio di vedervi </span><span class="c12">debitore</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;reale, che rendiate il </span><span class="c12">debito</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;vostro al vostro Creatore. Sapete che siamo tutti </span><span class="c12">debitori</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a Dio... Non pregammo mai che ci creasse: mosso dunque dal fuoco dell&rsquo;amore; creocci all&rsquo;immagine e similitudine sua.... Questo &egrave; il </span><span class="c12">debito</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;che noi abbiamo tratto da Dio: e questo </span><span class="c12">debito</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;vuole che gli sia renduto: cio&egrave; amore per amore.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">As in the letter cited above, here Catherine again discusses the debt that must be repaid as love for God, as humanity is created in God&rsquo;s image due to his being moved by the fire of love. As a debtor, the recipient is constructed as an ignorant thief &mdash; &ldquo;O ladro ignorante debitore&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;&mdash; who steals from his creator. Significantly, both in this phrase and in the phrase &ldquo;debitore reale&rdquo; at the start of the letter, Catherine calls this man a debtor outright, though in other letters she refers to all Christians as debtors. Because of her perceived gravity of his sin, Catherine believes herself to be justified in being more direct and does not speak in analogies. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the letter continues Catherine writes that we all shall pay our debts, but if the debt is not properly repaid, her addressee will suffer the consequences: &ldquo;renderemo il debito che dobbiamo rendere a Dio. Sappiate che se voi nol rendeste, voi cadereste nella pi&ugrave; scura prigione che si possa immaginare&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;(T21). This man must confess and hold his sin in contempt to return his debt or he will fall into the darkest prison imaginable (i.e. Hell). Of course, this is not entirely without reference to a Scriptural basis, as she echoes Mark 12:17 when she tells the homosexual to give to God what is his and to the earth what is the earth&rsquo;s (give to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s), but her choice of words and repetition shows her position as a public and rhetorical figure working to persuade others. As Cheryl Forbes notes, &ldquo;Catherine&rsquo;s images here &hellip; are earthly, not heavenly; they are concrete, not abstract&rdquo; (135). Using language that conjures the economic realm, Catherine is able to appeal to her contemporaries in words that they can easily relate to as metaphors for what is at stake in their spiritual lives.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter T311 differs from the previous two in that it is more explicitly political, addressed to the Sienese government writ large (&ldquo;A&rsquo; signori difensori del popolo e comune di Siena&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c0">). Believed to be written some time between October and mid-November 1379, this letter does not shy away from the language of indebtedness, employing variations of the word 12 times in a 1,460-word letter, but the use of the word &ldquo;debitori&rdquo; (&ldquo;debtors&rdquo;) is more tempered here. Unlike in T21, Catherine does not directly call the </span><span class="c0 c14">signori</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;this word as such, instead explaining that &ldquo;we&rdquo; are debtors: &ldquo;A cui siamo noi debitori?&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;She explains that we are debtors to God, Church, our neighbors, and ourselves. In the second instance of the word &ldquo;debitori,&rdquo; it appears as an analogy: &ldquo;come ladri a malvagi debitori, tollendo l&rsquo;altrui con molta ingiustizia.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;Whereas the homosexual in the letter above is referred to as a thieving debtor outright, the political leaders of Siena are only compared to thieving debtors. This discussion of indebtedness touches on similar themes of the other letters, and ends with a call to action, as do many of her letters and as discussed above with regards to her letters to Ristoro. She appeals to the Defenders to repay what they owe to God and to give Christ deeds rather than words:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Adunque, vedete che per ogni modo sete tenuti e obligati di rendere il debito alla santa Chiesa e al padre vostro &hellip; Pregovi per l&rsquo;amore di Cristo crocifisso, che voi non diate pi&ugrave; parole a Cristo in terra; ma dategli de&rsquo; fatti, erendetegli di quello che egli ha dato voi.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c0">Catherine wants the Sienese to remember that they are obligated to pay gratitude (their debts) to Urban VI for his having lifted Gregory XI&rsquo;s interdict that prohibited Florence and allied cities from participating in public worship and receiving sacraments, and also to recall that Urban VI is the legitimate Pope. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the Sienese are successful in repaying their debts in the actions she details, Catherine explains that they will be rewarded not just in the afterlife but on Earth as well. By the end of the letter, she becomes quite specific to her point, explaining how their good deeds can help them recover the port of Talamone from the Pisans through the mediation of the Pope that she will help to orchestrate.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;Thus, even though Catherine generally constructs indebtedness as loving oneself over God, and favoring time on Earth over concern about the eternal soul, Catherine makes allowances. Understanding the political gains that could be enjoyed through Siena working to legitimize Pope Urban VI against the antipope, Catherine promises earthly power to the government in the form of their regaining access to a port hold at Talamone. Though Catherine can afford to be more spiritually minded in her interactions with individuals, even when incorporating worldly financial language, she must be pragmatic in her political dealings for what she must have perceived to be the greater good of the Church and the faith.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because many of Catherine&rsquo;s interlocutors have the earthly power and financial backing to help her spiritual causes, she must often tread carefully in her letters to them. Though she may say to Madonna Jacoma, the widow of the Lord of Fuligno, that &ldquo;Elle danno, dico, molestia e scandalo le cose del mondo a chi le possiede fuori di Dio,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;her advice is generalized, and can be shifted depending on what she hopes to achieve (T264). Sometimes, she grants that God does give us enjoyable belongings and feelings on Earth, but that these pleasures are intended to serve a greater good, as she notes in a letter to Monna Stricca, the wife of Cione di Sandro Salimbeni (T110):</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Onde la ricchezza ci permette, perch&egrave; ne siamo disponsatori a&rsquo; poveri; le delizie e stati del mondo, non perch&egrave; noi leviamo il capo per la superbia: anco, molto maggiormente ci dobbiamo umiliare con un santo ringraziamento della divina bont&agrave;.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7 c0">Riches are permitted, but they should be redistributed to the poor; prosperity should remind us to be thankful to God. This is to say that the meditation on wealth, objects, and opportunities should be directed towards God and the eternal soul rather than to the earthly possessions or temporal states themselves; when one is presented with favorable fortune, they should ask themselves how they can do good works and serve God with it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c0">Unlike what is recounted in Matthew 19:24, that &ldquo;it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God,&rdquo; Catherine &mdash; with her mercantile background and desire to see political stability between Europe and the Church &mdash; accepts that there is a time and a place for wealth and power. Lorenzo del Pino, a nobleman from Bologna and a doctor and lecturer in ecclesiastical law at the university there, had inherited substantial wealth by the time Catherine writes letter T193 to him. While she mentions that &ldquo;Cristo abbracci&ograve; la povert&agrave; volontaria,&rdquo; she attempts to strike a middle ground with Lorenzo, who must be living like the wretches mentioned in the letter who hate truth. She writes:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Le ricchezze e lo stato del mondo, se l&rsquo;uomo le vuol tenere, il pu&ograve;; e non offende Dio n&eacute; l&rsquo;anima sua; ma se egli le lassasse, sarebbe maggior perfezione, per&ograve; che maggior perfezione &egrave; a lassare che a tenere. Ma s&rsquo;egli non vuole lassare attualmente, debbe lassare e rifiutare col santo desiderio, e non ponere in loro il suo principale affetto, ma solo in Dio; e tenerle per uso a&rsquo; suoi bisogni e della sua famigliae come cosa prestata, e non come cosa sua. Facendo cos&igrave; non riceve pena mai d&rsquo;alcuna cosa creata; perocch&eacute; la cosa che non si possiede per amore, non si perde mai con dolore.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Riches and status in the world do not offend God or the eternal soul, even though it would be more perfect to let these things go. The important aspect of one&rsquo;s relationship with that status and money or possessions is to perceive them as the temporal states and objects that they are. Catherine recommends seeing the prestige and riches as that which is lent to the possessor, rather than that which is owned outright by them. This important relationality, the knowledge that &ldquo;ogni cosa passa,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;serves to redirect vices towards virtues that mediate on a power higher than the self, while also allowing Catherine to make use of these temporal states in her work for the Church (T193). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Though Catherine lived in poverty by choice and did good works for the poor, Catherine had a large network of support that intersected with well-connected nobility and religious figures, perhaps leaving her with less of an understanding of all the possible realities of others. Towards the end of a letter to a prostitute of Perugia, she writes: &ldquo;E se tu mi dicessi: &laquo;il non avere di che vivere mi ritrae&raquo;; e io ti dico che Dio ti provveder&agrave;&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span class="c7 c0">&nbsp;(T276). Though we do not know the circumstances of this woman, she likely did not have a choice in the way she chose to support herself. While Catherine states that she hears the prostitute&rsquo;s brother will support her (the letter was written at the request of one of the woman&rsquo;s brothers), clearly the woman in question had not previously had this support, so the implied assistance seems tenuous at best. Though economic imagery is particularly fitting for a prostitute addressee, it seems uneven for Catherine to grant to rich patrons the solace that they are not living in sin despite their wealth, while to a prostitute she does not offer much other than empty words relating that &ldquo;God will provide for you&rdquo; when evidently he has not. To the prostitute as well as to the homosexual in letter T21, Catherine is less tempered and more dogmatic in her condemnation of their particular sins of the flesh, offering them less comfort than she does for those who are valuable to her cause. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c0">Catherine&rsquo;s use of financial metaphors can make the spiritual more commonplace and quotidian, and perhaps easier for some to understand. As a spiritual woman, Catherine remains outside of city commerce, as she lives more for her future heavenly life than for her current earth-bound one, but her use of monetary language shows her civic-mindedness, as she is employing a tangible financial contract in order to relate spiritual matters to a class of people within an increasingly mercantile society. In utilizing monetary language in letters about spiritual matters, Catherine strikes a careful balance between two often oppositional schools of thought, bringing them to bear on each other in a meaningful way to better teach her readers and remain as a figure embedded within two spheres. Ultimately, this speaks to her positionality as a mystic who is concerned with both this-worldly and other-worldly concerns at once. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c7 c18"></span></p><hr class="c13"><div><p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;In modern Italian editions, this word is rendered as &ldquo;la caparra,&rdquo; as in the 2006 Edizione Cantagalli.</span></p></div><div><p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref2" id="ftnt2">[2]</a><span class="c11">&nbsp;Chapter 28, &ldquo;Bene &egrave; dunque macto colui che schifa tanto bene, ed elegge innanzi, di gustare in questa vita </span><span class="c11 c16">l&rsquo;arra</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;de l&rsquo;inferno, tenendo per la via di sotto, dove va con molte fadighe e senza neuno refrigerio e senza veruno bene; per&ograve; che per lo peccato loro sonno privati di me che so&rsquo; sommo ed etterno Bene&rdquo; (emphasis mine).</span></p></div><div><p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt3">[3]</a><span class="c11">&nbsp;Available via </span><span class="c8"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://vocabolario.sns.it/html/_s_index2.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1486357433586000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGgA_O0aXn0mLlWWkZpyeLK1bTxNg">http://vocabolario.sns.it/html/_s_index2.html</a></span><span class="c2">. </span></p></div><div><p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref4" id="ftnt4">[4]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;T65, T322, T76, T359, T39, T331, T244, T83, T124, T241, T216, T64, T85, T301, T340, T335, T44, T38, T151a, T369, T355, T361, T299, T264, T360, T111, T310, T5, T20, T194, T258, T3, T276, T304, T48, T84, T143, T221, T104</span></p></div><div><p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref5" id="ftnt5">[5]</a><span class="c11">&nbsp;Available via </span><span class="c8"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DEphesians%2B1%253A14-16%26version%3DVULGATE&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1486357433589000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFnv60g--jPpAmfw6a49YV0Oai5lw">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A14-16&amp;version=VULGATE</a></span><span class="c11">. &ldquo;which is the pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory&rdquo; (</span><span class="c8"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DEphesians%25201:13-15%26version%3DKJ21&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1486357433590000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEw8nDJGT1TFlt4rdHVLZbsxxfQCA">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:13-15&amp;version=KJ21</a></span><span class="c2">)</span></p></div><div><p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref6" id="ftnt6">[6]</a><span class="c11">&nbsp;Definitions available via </span><span class="c8"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://latin-dictionary.net/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1486357433591000&amp;usg=AFQjCNECyQ151byDzaFOllM4Q5ocJiZ6GA">http://latin-dictionary.net/</a></span><span class="c2">. </span></p></div><div><p class="c3"><a href="#ftnt_ref7" id="ftnt7">[7]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;&ldquo;The Highest Good, whose sole joy is Himself, / made man to be-and to enact-good; He / gave man this place as pledge of endless peace&rdquo; Trans.
