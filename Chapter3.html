This chapter will consider the connections that Catherine made in her lifetime that are illuminated historically through her letter production, as well as analyze the strategic and rhetorical nature of her letters. Catherine&rsquo;s letters are </span><span class="c1">persuasive, evocative, and lyrical</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c1">, and serve as a material extension of her spirituality and </span><span class="c1">political engagement</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c1">, as well as markers of the many friendships she formed and nurtured throughout her life. Collected along with her </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;after her death, the letters were published first in a small collection of 31 letters printed by Fontanesi (Bologna, 1492), and were later followed by an edition of 353 letters printed by Aldo Manuzio (Venice, 1500) (</span><span class="c1">Cavallini</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;xiv).</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">In his book </span><span class="c1 c5">The Art of the Network: Strategic Interaction and Patronage in Renaissance Florence</span><span class="c2 c1">, Paul D. McLean discusses the role that letters play in building and sustaining relationships in 15th-century Italy. As a sociologist, he reflects broadly on how social interactions shape the lives of individuals, and how individuals are defined by those around them (1-2):</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c1">Our careers are made &mdash; and we are made &mdash; through our interactions with others, as well as through the performance of those tasks to which we have access by virtue of our connections to others. We become more fully the persons we are through interaction, our personhood being constructed out of a number of different identities we adopt, singly or in combination, in different interactional settings. We may achieve autonomy, and achieve a private conception of self independent of attributions of identity put upon us by others, through the accumulation of multiple network ties and participation in social interaction coursing across multiple networks and diverse cultural domains.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">A daughter of a wool-dyer father, Catherine grew up in a non-noble family that had some ties to religious professions. Despite her status as a 14th-century woman, Catherine managed to interact with people of high position through her persuasive writing (and speech acts)</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">, spirituality, and commitment to the social good. She maintained interactions across multiple networks &mdash; the lay, religious, and nobility &mdash; and through diverse cultural domains that extended beyond her home city of Siena. Her career &mdash; which included the roles of mystic, writer, ambassador, and what we may anachronistically call social worker &mdash; was largely successful due to the formation of her social ties. Though historically we cannot fully examine all the historical temporal-based works that she did to develop the network around her, the collection of her letters that we have provide an indication of the remarkable life that she negotiated for herself.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Catherine&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;letter-writing career begins before 1374 and extends to February 15, 1380, about two months before her death at the age of 33. Her letters were addressed to men and women geographically located throughout Siena, Tuscany, and beyond the Italian peninsula. Today we have 386 of her letters extant, though these are not wholly intact, as &ldquo;inspiration and edification were the purposes of those who were preparing the letters for dissemination, [with] all that was purely personal or informational [being] irrelevant&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c1 c5">Letters</span><span class="c1">, xxv). The versions of the letters that we have are based primarily on a canonization project, and today we only have the </span><span class="c1 c5">original</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;transcriptions of eight of the letters (Noffke, </span><span class="c1 c5">Letters</span><span class="c1">, xxii). Though we cannot be certain that we have access to some form of all the letters that she wrote, nor can we be absolutely sure that these letters are written and copied as Catherine intended as there were many opportunities for alterations,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;I agree with Noffke&rsquo;s assertion that &ldquo;There is little cause &hellip; to question the essential authenticity of the text as we have it, even though it is not in Catherine&rsquo;s own hand&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c1 c5">Letters</span><span class="c2 c1">, xxiii). This collection of letters, therefore, provides a revealing glimpse into Catherine&rsquo;s historical reality and serves as a document of her literary power. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c2 c1">Though Catherine opted to use the Italian language throughout her writing and correspondence (as discussed above), her reach crossed linguistic barriers and into greater Europe through letters to the Avignon papal court; Charles V, King of France and his brother Louis, Duke of Anjou; Louis the Great and Elizabeth of Hungary. The heatmap of Catherine&rsquo;s recipients (Fig. 1), which takes into account the known locations of letter recipients (308 of the total), shows how Catherine&rsquo;s output radiates from Siena, reaches to the north and to the south, and trickles into Europe. This is also reflective of some of the travels that Catherine made during her lifetime, throughout Tuscany, to Avignon and to Rome. The spread of her letters does not speak only to geographical diversity, but to linguistic variety as well. Italian, a relatively new vernacular language, was even more formally varied at the time of Catherine&rsquo;s writing than it is in contemporary dialects today, as the language developed and clustered throughout what would become Italy. Catherine&rsquo;s recipients within Italy did not consist solely of native Italian speakers, as she wrote to the Englishmen William Fleet and John Hawkwood while both in Italy, the French-born Pope Gregory XI in his travel to and settlement in Rome, and many of her bilingually educated male correspondents may have been more accustomed to writing in Latin rather than Italian, especially as a lingua franca. </span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 584.10px; height: 353.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image09.png" style="width: 584.10px; height: 353.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Fig. 1, interactive online version: </span><span class="c1 c18"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/CatherineLetterMap&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1485760729746000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZ6ntXgAmEDWeyPuENe0sRENwxBA">http://bit.ly/CatherineLetterMap</a></span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Catherine&rsquo;s adeptness at cultivating her network probably began with her decision to join the </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a</span><span class="c1">t about 18 years old, as it was a tertiary group that allowed her access to the Dominican Order and also provided her with relative autonomy as a lay practitioner. While in Pisa in 1375 on a diplomatic mission working to sway Pisa and Lucca in favor of the papacy, Catherine began to write letters frequently and in a manner that would continue to be developed throughout her letter writing career which persisted for the rest of her life. F. Thomas Luongo notes (</span><span class="c1 c5">Saintly Politics</span><span class="c1">, 81)</span><span class="c2 c1">,</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c1">Catherine&rsquo;s letters from Pisa reveal an increasingly intense preoccupation with the dispute and its threat to church unity, and develop what was to become a familiar theme in her letters to secular and clerical leaders: a three-pronged program for peace in Italy and the church, consisting of the interdependent goals of Crusade, return of the pope to Rome, and ecclesiastical reform.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What is particularly noteworthy about Catherine&rsquo;s letters, is that they present to us a literate community of women from the 14th century, material echoes of exchange between </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and other women who wrote letters to each other in absence, or to offer advice and spiritual guidance. </span><span class="c2 c1">Of her letters that survive, one-third of them were written to women, proving the significance of her relationships with women, as well as her esteem of them, as she chooses to not only address the pope, political leaders and her confessors in her letters, but the women belonging to her order as well as those from different classes. The female community she belonged to was also significant in the propagation of her letters, as they were her first scribes. The dispersal of Catherine&rsquo;s letters therefore establishes a group of women capable of reading and writing in the vernacular and, though this was not considered to be literacy in a Latinate world, reveals the community-based education attained by these individuals. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">More than negotiating the various intricacies of a classed society, the letters Catherine wrote also straddled the public and private realms of her cultural context; Catherine wrote on both political and spiritual matters, often to public figures, but did so in the intimate medium of the personal letter. Letters to the Pope, Catherine must have known, would not have been read solely by him, and indeed the personal letters arrived with a public performance, as Raymond sent an accompanying messenger to Pope Gregory XI in order to interpret, </span><span class="c1 c5">viva voce</span><span class="c1">, Catherine&rsquo;s Italian words into Latin (Tylus 161). Her letters were also often written in a communal manner with fellow </span><span class="c1 c5">Mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;nearby and serving as her scribes, as in T204 addressed to Bartolomeo Dominici, which shows community and jocularity at once: &ldquo;Dice Alessia grassotta, che voi preghiate Dio per lei e per me, e per Cecca perditrice di tempo.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">Catherine&rsquo;s acts of mediation are further embodied by the language registers she employs in the texts of the letters themselves. F. Thomas Luongo observes that Catherine (74) </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c1">mixes elements of high formality (for example, the superpapal self-identification as &ldquo;servant and slave of the servants of Jesus Christ&rdquo;) with a chatty style typical of a personal letter (for instance, the informal and simple closing, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say more,&rdquo; a typical element of Tuscan secular and mercantile letters). The tone of Catherine&rsquo;s letters is not popular or colloquial, but frequently strikes a lofty and prophetic register; nevertheless, consistent with the style of the personal letter, the language is her own Sienese vernacular, immediate and familiar, a &ldquo;low&rdquo; form of language. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Through mixing registers between her opening and closing statements, Catherine shows her relative ease with negotiating a more learned rhetorical approach indicative of a public document with the features of a textual conversation between friends. Catherine mixes her serious religious guidance with &ldquo;small shreds of gossip and conversation,&rdquo; as Jane Tylus notes (33).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">Catherine works to blends orality of chattiness with a strict and consistent formality that is in keeping with her spiritual mission. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of Catherine&rsquo;s letters follow a strict formal opening that</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;adhere to the literary genre of the letter, and closely follow the example of papal letters. While rhetorically positioning herself as a humble </span><span class="c1">servant in a rhetorical move on which to base her persuasion, Catherine then continues on to convey to her correspondant what she wants for them to do</span><span class="c1">. The introductory sentences of letter T236 to the nobleman Bartolo Usimbardi, for instance, exemplifies Catherine&rsquo;s practice:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Al nome di Ges&ugrave; Cristo crocifisso e di Maria dolce. Carissimo figliuolo in Cristo dolce Ges&ugrave;.

Evoking the blood of Christ as her ink connects her letters to the common literary trope of the Middle Ages while also connoting the precious nature of her missile. By setting up these relational values, Catherine&rsquo;s request to her recipient is justified and even expected; it is as though Catherine is submitting a resume showing her qualifications prior to making demands. This careful positioning, along with her ability to comfortably write in very formal and very candid registers appropriate to each addressee reveals Catherine&rsquo;s adeptness at negotiation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though her letters are offered as personalized </span><span class="c1">correspondence typically tailored to an individual, they also provide a general spiritual value to her direct followers and even future Christians. Catherine was aware that her letters to the Pope were being read to him aloud, likely before a larger audience of his counselors and others. Moreover, she would know that items in the Pope&rsquo;s possession would enjoy a life beyond that of its owner, being of interest not just to those of his own time, but to those in the future. She knew that her letters, like other spiritual texts, that circulated through churches would have been saved in church registries, especially as her reputation grew. Even in her own capacity, Catherine would sometimes tell her recipients, or messenger-scribes to share the letters with others by passing them along or reading them aloud, so that a wider audience would be able to benefit from them (Tylus 190, 201). Indeed, the major themes of her letters were often general enough to be applicable to many. As Karen Scott notes, Catherine&rsquo;s letters often discuss a &ldquo;main virtue which she wishes her correspondents to understand and practice better&hellip;&rdquo; demonstrating that her letters can be situated in a wider spiritual discourse applicable to many (100). Her request to preserve not just her </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but her &ldquo;other writings&rdquo; as well </span><span class="c1">affirms that Catherine is aware of the textual legacy of her letters and believes that the work will continue to serve God by reaching living people.</span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Financial Language in the Letters</span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine&rsquo;s letters prove to be quite pragmatic and aware of her readership, providing worldly language, and monetary language in particular, as a means to drive home spiritual teachings. Though one may expect monetary analogies to be most effective with a lay and noble audience, Catherine also employs economic metaphors when writing letters addressed to religious recipients. As Catherine and her contemporaries were living during a time when the mercantile class was flourishing, trade was increasing, and written language was becoming more accessible to the general population (i.e., the rise of the vernacular in Europe), commercial and monetary concerns touched a greater portion of society. This blending of the spiritual and the earthly shows a careful negotiation of mixed signs that can at times seem contradictory, especially as Catherine&rsquo;s teachings encourage poverty. The letters to nobles in particular must achieve a prudent balance in an effort to be complimentary to those who are likely providing some financial or political support to herself, and theological teachings that favor poverty over riches. </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 512.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image06.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 512.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">In 39 letters, 15 of which were written to women, Catherine uses the economic metaphor o</span><span class="c1">f &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;a word that Catherine also uses in the </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and which</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Suzanne Noffke explains &ldquo;has the sense of a down payment, a pledge of future payment in full&rdquo; (</span><span class="c1 c5">The Dialogue</span><span class="c1">, 68). The 1612 edition of the </span><span class="c1 c5">Vocabolario dell&rsquo;Accademia della Crusca</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(Venezia) provides the following definition for the word </span><span class="c1 c5">arra</span><span class="c1">: &ldquo;propriamente parte di pagamento della mercatantia pattuita, che si da al creditore per sicurt&agrave;, laquale, in caso, la mercatantia non si volesse, si perde.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;The word therefore has a sense of a deposit, a payment installment, or a guarantee that the item will be paid in full at a future point in time. In her letters, Catherine uses the phrases &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra d&rsquo;inferno&rdquo; (&ldquo;down payment on hell&rdquo;) and &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna,&rdquo; (&ldquo;down payment on the eternal life&rdquo;) most frequently, with just &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra&rdquo; used twice and &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra della morte eternale&rdquo; used once to Raymond.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;In the chart above, we can see that she uses the phrase &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna&rdquo; most often for male religious, and more so for men than for women throughout each class (religious, noble, and lay), respectively. Women were far more likely to receive the phrase &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra d&rsquo;inferno,&rdquo; except for in the case of female religious. Catherine is therefore much more likely to tell women that they are making a down payment on hell while telling men that they are making a down payment on the eternal life in paradise. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Striking a parallel between financial language and spiritual matters is not original, but Catherine uses this analogy frequently. The Latin Vulgate version (the one Catherine would have been familiar with) of the Epistle to the Ephesians (the tenth book of the New Testament) includes the passage </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;qui est pignus hereditatis nostrae in redemptionem adquisitionis in laudem gloriae ipsius&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">(Ephesians 1:14)</span><span class="c1">.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Both &ldquo;pignus&rdquo; and &ldquo;adquisitionis&rdquo; have economic connotations, with &ldquo;pignus&rdquo; referring to a pledge (or security for debt) or a mortgage, and &ldquo;adquisitionis&rdquo; referring to an acquisition.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Following the canonical text of the Bible ensures that Catherine is not using language that is far removed from tradition, which could serve to protect her as a woman writing about spiritual matters. As neither of the Latin words used in Ephesians are a cognate for &ldquo;arra,&rdquo; it is worth noting that Dante does use this word in </span><span class="c1 c5">Purgatorio</span><span class="c1">: &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Lo sommo Ben, che solo esso a s&eacute; piace, / f&eacute; l&rsquo;uom buono e a bene, e questo loco / diede per </span><span class="c4">arr&rsquo; a lui d&rsquo;etterna pace</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; (28, 91-93, emphasis mine).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dante uses this language in the passage narrated by Matilda in the earthly paradise, where she gives the historical context of Eden and explains that &ldquo;the high Good&rdquo; paid a down payment to man for eternal peace. Even predating Dante, is the work of female mystic Angela da Foligno, whose Latin text, often referred to as her &ldquo;</span><span class="c1 c5">Libro</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; (as with Catherine&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo</span><span class="c2 c1">), also uses the word &ldquo;arra:&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Studeamus igitur sustinere tribulationes temporales cum patientia, immo &amp; cum gaudio.

Even if this were not the case, the use of the common word of &ldquo;arra&rdquo; suggests again that there is an exchange between mystical and poetic writing, as writers in both genres are using this specific financial word to write about spirituality. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c2 c1">In one of Catherine&rsquo;s letters to Don Giovanni dalle Celle, a Vallombrosan whom she met at his hermitage outside Florence in 1374, she explains that those who are full of love for God taste the down payment they make on the eternal life, while those who direct love to themselves taste the deposit they make on hell (T322):</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Non gli &egrave; duro il portare pena n&egrave; fadiga; anco gli &egrave; diletto, perch&egrave; con odio santo ha abbandonato s&egrave; medesimo, onde riluce in lui la virt&ugrave; della pazienza, con le sue sorelle, cio&egrave; fortezza e longa perseveranzia. Questi gusta l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna: siccome quegli che stanno nell&#39;amore proprio,gustano l&rsquo;arra dell&#39;inferno; perch&egrave; sono fatti incomportabili a loro medesimi, amando disordinatamente s&egrave; e le creature e le cose create.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">The letter, believed to be dated shortly after December 13, 1378, is the second letter she has addressed to Don Giovanni dalle Celle, and in it, she encourages him to follow through to be present at the council of the servants of God that Urban VI had invited him to join in Rome. The letter deals with the theme of charity, which she refers to as a &ldquo;dolce madre&rdquo; (&ldquo;sweet mother&rdquo;), and she explains that she is sure that if his love were to be consumed in the oven of divine charity he will certainly leave behind his selfish love, but she constructs her letter to suggest that his responding positively to the invitation from the pope is a kind of test of this love:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Or m&rsquo;avvedr&ograve; se voi sarete amatori di Dio e della reformazione di santa Chiesa, e se voi non ragguarderete alle proprie consolazioni. Son certa che, se voi averete consumato l&#39;amore proprio in questa fornace, voi non curerete d&rsquo;abbandonare la cella e le vostre consolazioni; ma piglierete la cella del cognoscimento di voi, e con essa verrete a ponere la vita, se bisogner&agrave;, per la verit&agrave; dolce. Altrimenti, no. E per&ograve; vi dissi ch&rsquo;io desideravo di vedere consumato ogni amore proprio di voi nella fornace della divina carit&agrave;.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As one of her &ldquo;staunchest defenders,&rdquo; Don Giovanni dalle Celle was likely living a life consistent with what Catherine describes as being a lover of God, but in this letter she is setting out to ensure that he will dedicate himself to reform the Church (Noffke, </span><span class="c1 c5">Letters</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Vol. IV, 35). By setting up the financial dichotomy between those who direct their love towards God in the act of divine charity, and those who direct their love inwards towards selfish comforts, Catherine is able to emphasize that these choices serve as deposits on the eternal life.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a series of letters Catherine uses variations on the theme of the down payment, which seems to be indicative of the spiritual growth of the addressee. Serving as a patron and disciple to Catherine, Ristoro di Piero Canigiani was a learned lawyer as well as a leading Guelf in Florence. The son of Piero Canigiani and older brother of Barduccio, he acted in a political capacity on behalf of Florence in dealings with Queen Giovanna of Naples and Gregory XI. Catherine first writes to support him through the Revolt of the Ciompi, a rebellion of unrepresented laborers that began in Florence in 1378. The houses of prominent Guelfs &mdash; considered to be enemies of the people &mdash; were looted and burned around June 22, 1378, and his house and his father&rsquo;s were among those that were damaged. His father was also exiled from the city. Catherine does not explicitly mention these events in her first letter to Ristoro, T299, but mentions a tragic event in his life, causing Noffke to date this to July 1378 (</span><span class="c1 c5">Letters</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;III, 160). In this letter, she discusses how loving material goods is problematic, because those are only loaned to us, and we will be parted with those goods either during life (when God wills it), or when we die. If people love with sensual love, and with love of the world and its pleasures, people make down payments on hell, as she mentions twice in this single letter:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Questo &egrave; quello miserabile amore che tolle il lume della ragione, e non lassa cognoscere la verit&agrave;; tolle la vita della Grazia, e dacci la morte; tolleci la libert&agrave;, e facciservi e schiavi del peccato, che &egrave; quella cosa che non &egrave;: onde in questa vita gusta l&rsquo;arra dell&rsquo;inferno.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2 c1">...</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Egli &egrave; fatto incomportabile a s&egrave; medesimo: onde gusta l&rsquo;arra dell&rsquo;inferno; per&ograve; che il vermine della coscienzia sempre rode. </span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">What is significant in these instances is that Catherine contextualizes the love of money and possessions with the idea of a down payment, striking a very apt parallel that can prove to be effective for those in the noble class, especially at a time when those in Florence are suffering from having lost many of their earthly possessions. Catherine&rsquo;s letter continues to explain that the love of God, which can be manifested in acts of charity, is a love that cannot be taken away as sensual love can. She writes, &ldquo;E per&ograve; questi cotali di neuna cosa possono avere pena, perocch&egrave; hanno posto l&rsquo;amore e l&rsquo;affetto in quella cosa che non gli pu&ograve; essere tolta,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;insisting that those who order their lives around God &mdash; acting with integrity in marriage, raising children to love God, and doing works of charity &mdash; will suffer no pain because love and affection cannot be taken away from them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the next letter addressed to him (T258), it is clear that Catherine had received a letter from Ristoro in which he described his commitment to reforming his life. She responded some time prior to August 10, &ldquo;when the lifting of the interdict was publicly proclaimed in Florence&rdquo; (Noffle </span><span class="c1 c5">Letters</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;III 170). In this letter, Catherine discusses her happiness to see his &ldquo;santo desiderio&rdquo; (&ldquo;holy desire&rdquo;), explaining that his effort to forgive those who had wronged him will ensure that he lives in grace and peace. Those who live in hatred, however, &ldquo;&egrave; privato di Dio, e sta in stato di dannazione; e in questa vita gusta l&rsquo;arra dell&rsquo;inferno: perocch&egrave; sempre si rode in s&egrave; medesimo, e appetisce vendetta, e sta sempre con timore.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Again, there is the worldly image of making a deposit on the infernal afterlife through hatred, revenge, and fear. As the analogy had worked effectively in letter T299, Catherine uses it again, urging the noble Ristoro to continue to redirect his devotion to temporal possessions towards God instead. Catherine&rsquo;s letter moves on to advise him to unburden his conscience of whatever he thinks is weighing it down, offering him concrete actionable tasks that she enumerates for his benefit. The fourth item that Catherine advises Ristoro on is his marriage:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Aggiungoci una cosa: che nello stato del matrimonio voi stiate con timore di Dio, e con riverenzia v&rsquo;andiate come a sacramento, e non con disordinato desiderio. E i d&igrave; che sono comandati dalla santa Chiesa, abbiate in debita riverenzia, siccome uomo ragionevole, e non come animale bruto. Allora di voi e di lei, siccome arbori buoni, producerete buoni frutti.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">Despite her lack of earthly experience in the domain of human marriage, Catherine is able to offer advice on best practices, revealing her adeptness at being aware of her audience and constructing spiritual paths that are attainable across personal circumstances.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In T301, her last letter to Ristoro, which Noffke dates later than T279 to mid-November 1378, Catherine implies that the recipient and his wife are earnestly considering the abstinence she had recommended in previous letters (</span><span class="c1 c5">Letters</span><span class="c1">, Vol. III, 332). Catherine is very happy for his commitment to spiritual love, and as she wants to see him continue to grow in &ldquo;il lume e la virt&ugrave;&rdquo; (&ldquo;light and virtue&rdquo;), she tells him to focus on a few things. Again, these are very task-oriented, providing Ristoro with particular actions to carry out. As part of contextualizing the list as well as encouraging him to follow a virtuous path, she writes, &ldquo;La virt&ugrave; gli &egrave; tanto piacevole, che dell&rsquo;uomo virtuoso egli ne fa un altro s&egrave; per affetto dolce d&rsquo;amore; e in questa vita gli fa gustare l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna: che stando nel mare tempestoso delle molte fadighe e amaritudini, gusta la pace e la dolcezza.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;In this letter there is a shift from a down payment on hell to a deposit or a pledge of eternal life. Catherine&rsquo;s letters to Ristoro reveal a trajectory towards spiritual growth including some kind of virtuous spiritual attainment through Catherine&rsquo;s financial knowledge that moves the recipient as paying down for a place in Hell to securing a position in Paradise instead. However, rather than Ristoro pledging money on eternal life, it seems more likely in this context that in return for virtuosity, God is offering a backed pledge on the eternal life to Ristoro, such that he can taste peace and sweetness during his time on Earth through doing good in the world. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, people on Earth are not the only ones engaging in financial exchanges, as Catherine explicitly discusses Christ&rsquo;s making a financial pledge to his followers in a letter to the Queen of Naples, Giovanna d&rsquo;Angi&ograve; (T143). By adding the verb &ldquo;pagare&rdquo; (&ldquo;to pay&rdquo;) alongside &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra,&rdquo; Catherine makes the monetary image even more explicit. She writes:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">O dolcissimo amore Ges&ugrave;, in segno che tu l&rsquo;avevi presa per sposa, in capo degli otto d&igrave; tu le donasti l&rsquo;anello della dolcissima e santissima mano tua, nel tempo della santa Circoncisione. Cos&igrave; sapete voi, venerabile madre mia, che in capo degli otto d&igrave;, se silev&ograve; tanta carne quanta &egrave; un cerchio d&#39;anello, e cominci&ograve; a pagarci l&rsquo;arra, per darci pienamente speranza del pagamento, il quale ricevemmo in su &lsquo;l legno della santissima croce, quando questo sposo, Agnello immacolato, fu svenato, e da ogni parte vers&ograve; abbondanzia di sangue col quale lav&ograve; le immondizie e peccati della sposa sua, cio&egrave; l&rsquo;umana generazione.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Catherine&rsquo;s imagery of Christ&rsquo;s circumcision is unique to her, though Dupr&eacute; Theseider suggests that there may be a basis for it in Exodus 4, 25-26 (n. 4).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;In comparing Christ&rsquo;s foreskin to a ring, she is giving it earthly value. In other letters in which she describes Christ&rsquo;s foreskin to a ring given to his followers, she provides additional details </span><span class="c1 c5">in abstentia</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for the ring: it is neither gold nor silver.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Christ&rsquo;s foreskin being implicitly likened to precious metals provides added financial value to the ring, yet Catherine emphasizes that the foreskin is worth so much more, as it is made of Christ&rsquo;s flesh and indicative of his first pain, that it is even better than a monetary pledge of the crucifixion to come. As Caroline Walker Bynum notes, &ldquo;But Catherine herself, in letter after letter, says we do not marry Christ with gold or silver but with the ring of Christ&rsquo;s foreskin, given in the Circumcision and accompanied by pain and the shedding of blood &hellip; shed for the sake of the world&rdquo; (</span><span class="c1 c5">Holy Feast, Holy Fast</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;175). The blood and flesh shed during Christ&rsquo;s circumcision is a small sacrifice that show Christ&rsquo;s commitment to his followers, and is the first payment he makes to them. Eventually, he pays for all of their sins in full through his crucifixion, inviting them all to the wedding feast that they will find in Paradise.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imagery of the wedding is canonical in Christian writing, but it brings with it additional layers of earthly and financial imagery. Following the excerpt quoted above in T143 to Giovannad&rsquo;Angi&ograve;, the letter continues:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">E attendete, che il fuoco della divina Carit&agrave; ci ha donato l&rsquo;anello non d&rsquo;oro, ma della purissima carne sua; e hacci fatte le nozze, questo dolcissimo Padre, non di carne d&rsquo;animale, ma del prezioso corpo suo: ed &egrave; questo cibo e Agnello arrostito al fuoco della Carit&agrave; in su il legno della dolce croce. Adunque io vi prego dolcissimamente in Cristo Ges&ugrave;, che il cuore e l&rsquo;anima con ogni suo affetto e movimento e sollecitudine si levi ad amare e a servire s&igrave; dolce e caropadre e sposo quanto &egrave; Dio, somma e eterna Verit&agrave;, quale ci am&ograve; veramente, e senza essere amato.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As in other letters, the ring here is described as being more valuable than gold, and the feast of the wedding is a feast on the body of Christ. The flame that cooks the flesh is the fire of </span><span class="c1 c5">caritas</span><span class="c1">, and the wood on which it is cooked is that of the cross. All of the material goods of the wedding are brought by God, including the ring and the banquet, and love is paid to the followers of God with no expectation of reciprocation, though Catherine urges followers to love and serve. Paying for a wedding, and paying a dowry (though Christ is typically depicted as the bridegroom rather than the bride), are all financial circumstances that Catherine&rsquo;s contemporaries would have understood. They would also understand faithfulness as an integral component of marriage, which Catherine goes onto describe later in the letter: &ldquo;prima che romper la fede allo Sposo eterno suo.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Catherine&rsquo;s letters explain to their recipients that Christ makes a down payment with his circumcision and a full payment with his crucifixion to ensure that his followers can live an eternal life, but it is necessary that his followers do not counter this payment with their own payments on hell instead.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Christ has made a full payment on the eternal life for the sake of his followers, all are indebted to him. To capture the significance of what Christians owe to God, Catherine uses the language of being in debt, and of sinners as being debtors (and indeed, all humans are sinners to some degree). This symbolism is used in chapter 25 of her </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">, where she asks why he is so merciful: &ldquo;Chi ti muove a fare tanta misericordia? L&rsquo;amore; non </span><span class="c4">il debito</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;o il bisogno che tu abbia di noi, poich&eacute; noi siamo rei e malvagi </span><span class="c4">debitori</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; (emphasis mine).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;The answer that it is love that compels God to be so merciful to his followers, as he has no real need of the wicked debtors. Catherine uses the word &ldquo;debito&rdquo; in 101 of her letters, about 26% of her extant letters. Indebtedness, and its intersections with broader economic language, is an important aspect of Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality, and throughout her corpus of letters, she uses the symbolism in a different manner. &nbsp;To exemplify her varied approaches, we will consider three letters in particular, one to Niccol&ograve; Soderini, one to an unnamed homosexual, and one to the Defenders of the People and the City of Florence. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noffke dates letter T171 to late February 1376, when Niccol&ograve; di Ruggero (Geri) Soderini was one of the </span><span class="c1 c5">priori delle Arti</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in Florence (Noffke,</span><span class="c1 c5">&nbsp;Letters</span><span class="c2 c1">, Vol. II, 22). It is likely that Soderini had become Catherine&rsquo;s friend and disciple during her 1374 stay in Florence, and we have three letters in total written to him (T131 was dated earlier, and T247 later). In addition to focusing on the idea of indebtedness, this letter also takes up the words &ldquo;legare&rdquo; (to bind), &ldquo;lega&rdquo; (league), and &ldquo;legame&rdquo; (bond), suggestive of Florence&rsquo;s intention to join the antipapal league which was not formalized until July 24th of that year. Throughout this letter, Catherine makes use of several themes and word plays, showing her ability to imbue her letters with complicated and intertwined messages. In this letter, the language around indebtedness likens the relationship between Christians and God to the relationship between a son and his father. The son is forever indebted to his father for having been made of his flesh, and for having been given this flesh without having asked. She writes:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">O non pu&ograve; mai offenderlo (n&eacute; debbe offendere) che non sia in pericolo di morte, e in stato di dannazione. Egli &egrave; sempre debitore a lui, per l&rsquo;essere che gli ha dato: e non preg&ograve; mai il figliuolo il padre, che gli desse della sustanzia della carne sua; nondimeno il padre, mosso per l&rsquo;amore ch&#39;egli ha al figliuolo prima ch&rsquo;egli abbia l&rsquo;essere, gliel d&agrave;. Oh quanto maggiormente noi ignoranti ingrati sconoscenti figliuoli possiamo patire di offendere il nostro vero Padre! Conciossiacosach&eacute; ci abbia amati senza essere amato; perocch&eacute; per amore ci cre&ograve; e anco ci ricre&ograve; a Grazia nel sangue suo &hellip; e tutto ci ha dato per grazia, e non per debito.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As the son should never offend the father, Christians should never offend God, indeed it would be considered a worse transgression, and is viewed as pursuing death for having flagrantly gone against the one who granted life. Catherine is also incredibly clear in her analogy, not only does she refer to &ldquo;vero Padre&rdquo; in the quote above, but earlier in the letter she also writes, &ldquo;Adunque con sollicitudine d&rsquo;andare a dimandare l&rsquo;adiutorio del Padre, cio&egrave; di Dio, conviencelo addimandare.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Other imagery in the letter calls to mind Dante&rsquo;s schismatics of Canto 28, as she discusses cutting and joining, conflating their schism-inducing behavior of considering to join the antipapal league with the financial trope of being indebt and not making the appropriate payments, as though being in debt cuts one off from the greater whole.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Letter T21, dated to between February and April 1376, and believed to have been written during Holy Week (April 6-11), is written to a homosexual man, whom she addresses in the formal </span><span class="c1 c5">voi</span><span class="c1">, and whose name has since been scratched out. Noffke notes that the rubric reveals that here is a place where the copyist deliberately removed the name of the recipient, and also omitted &ldquo;some words unfitting for anyone to know,&rdquo; which Noffke posits to be &ldquo;something Catherine regarded as even worse than homosexual behavior&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c1 c5">Letters</span><span class="c1">, Vol. II, 144). Using similar language to the down payment, but instead constructing it as a debt, she uses variations of the word </span><span class="c1 c5">debito</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;11 times throughout this 1,400-word letter. In the first few lines alone she writes the word five times (emphasis mine):</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">...scrivo a voi nel prezioso sangue suo; con desiderio di vedervi </span><span class="c4">debitore</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;reale, che rendiate il </span><span class="c4">debito</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;vostro al vostro Creatore. Sapete che siamo tutti </span><span class="c4">debitori</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a Dio... Non pregammo mai che ci creasse</span><span class="c1">: mosso dunque dal fuoco dell&rsquo;amore; creocci all&rsquo;immagine e similitudine sua...</span><span class="c1">. Questo &egrave; il </span><span class="c4">debito</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;che noi abbiamo tratto da Dio: e questo </span><span class="c4">debito</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;vuole che gli sia renduto: cio&egrave; amore per amore.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As in the letter cited above, here Catherine again discusses the debt that must be repaid as love for God, as humanity is created in God&rsquo;s image due to his being moved by the fire of love. As a debtor, the recipient is constructed as an ignorant thief &mdash; &ldquo;O ladro ignorante debitore&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&mdash; who steals from his creator. Significantly, both in this phrase and in the phrase &ldquo;debitore reale&rdquo; at the start of the letter, Catherine calls this man a debtor outright, though in other letters she refers to all Christians as debtors. Because of her perceived gravity of his sin, Catherine believes herself to be justified in being more direct and does not speak in analogies. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">As the letter continues Catherine writes that we all shall pay our debts, but if the debt is not properly repaid, her addressee will suffer the consequences: &ldquo;renderemo il debito che dobbiamo rendere a Dio. Sappiate che se voi nol rendeste, voi cadereste nella pi&ugrave; scura prigione che si possa immaginare&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;(T21). This man must confess and hold his sin in contempt to return his debt or he will fall into the darkest prison imaginable (i.e. Hell). Of course, this is not entirely without reference to a Scriptural basis, as she echoes Mark 12:17 when she tells the homosexual to give to God what is his and to the earth what is the earth&rsquo;s (give to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s), but her choice of words and repetition shows her position as a public and rhetorical figure working to persuade others. As Cheryl Forbes notes, &ldquo;Catherine&rsquo;s images here &hellip; are earthly, not heavenly; they are concrete, not abstract&rdquo; (135). Using language that conjures the economic realm, Catherine is able to appeal to her contemporaries in words that they can easily relate to as metaphors for what is at stake in their spiritual lives.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter T311 differs from the previous two in that it is more explicitly political, addressed to the Sienese government writ large (&ldquo;A&rsquo; signori difensori del popolo e comune di Siena&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c1">). Believed to be written some time between October and mid-November 1379, this letter does not shy away from the language of indebtedness, employing variations of the word 12 times in a 1,460-word letter, but the use of the word &ldquo;debitori&rdquo; (&ldquo;debtors&rdquo;) is more tempered here. Unlike in T21, Catherine does not directly call the </span><span class="c1 c5">signori</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;this word as such, instead explaining that &ldquo;we&rdquo; are debtors: &ldquo;A cui siamo noi debitori?&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;She explains that we are debtors to God, Church, our neighbors, and ourselves. In the second instance of the word &ldquo;debitori,&rdquo; it appears as an analogy: &ldquo;come ladri a malvagi debitori, tollendo l&rsquo;altrui con molta ingiustizia.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Whereas the homosexual in the letter above is referred to as a thieving debtor outright, the political leaders of Siena are only compared to thieving debtors. This discussion of indebtedness touches on similar themes of the other letters, and ends with a call to action, as do many of her letters and as discussed above with regards to her letters to Ristoro. She appeals to the Defenders to repay what they owe to God and to give Christ deeds rather than words:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Adunque, vedete che per ogni modo sete tenuti e obligati di rendere il debito alla santa Chiesa e al padre vostro &hellip; Pregovi per l&rsquo;amore di Cristo crocifisso, che voi non diate pi&ugrave; parole a Cristo in terra; ma dategli de&rsquo; fatti, erendetegli di quello che egli ha dato voi.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">Catherine wants the Sienese to remember that they are obligated to pay gratitude (their debts) to Urban VI for his having lifted Gregory XI&rsquo;s interdict that prohibited Florence and allied cities from participating in public worship and receiving sacraments, and also to recall that Urban VI is the legitimate Pope. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">If the Sienese are successful in repaying their debts in the actions she details, Catherine explains that they will be rewarded not just in the afterlife but on Earth as well. By the end of the letter, she becomes quite specific to her point, explaining how their good deeds can help them recover the port of Talamone from the Pisans through the mediation of the Pope that she will help to orchestrate.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Thus, even though Catherine generally constructs indebtedness as loving oneself over God, and favoring time on Earth over concern about the eternal soul, Catherine makes allowances. Understanding the political gains that could be enjoyed through Siena working to legitimize Pope Urban VI against the antipope, Catherine promises earthly power to the government in the form of their regaining access to a port hold at Talamone. Though Catherine can afford to be more spiritually minded in her interactions with individuals, even when incorporating worldly financial language, she must be pragmatic in her political dealings for what she must have perceived to be the greater good of the Church and the faith.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because many of Catherine&rsquo;s interlocutors have the earthly power and financial backing to help her spiritual causes, she must often tread carefully in her letters to them. Though she may say to Madonna Jacoma, the widow of the Lord of Fuligno, that &ldquo;Elle danno, dico, molestia e scandalo le cose del mondo a chi le possiede fuori di Dio,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;her advice is generalized, and can be shifted depending on what she hopes to achieve (T264). Sometimes, she grants that God does give us enjoyable belongings and feelings on Earth, but that these pleasures are intended to serve a greater good, as she notes in a letter to Monna Stricca, the wife of Cione di Sandro Salimbeni (T110):</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Onde la ricchezza ci permette, perch&egrave; ne siamo disponsatori a&rsquo; poveri; le delizie e stati del mondo, non perch&egrave; noi leviamo il capo per la superbia: anco, molto maggiormente ci dobbiamo umiliare con un santo ringraziamento della divina bont&agrave;.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">Riches are permitted, but they should be redistributed to the poor; prosperity should remind us to be thankful to God. This is to say that the meditation on wealth, objects, and opportunities should be directed towards God and the eternal soul rather than to the earthly possessions or temporal states themselves; when one is presented with favorable fortune, they should ask themselves how they can do good works and serve God with it.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c2 c1">Unlike what is recounted in Matthew 19:24, that &ldquo;it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God,&rdquo; Catherine &mdash; with her mercantile background and desire to see political stability between Europe and the Church &mdash; accepts that there is a time and a place for wealth and power. Lorenzo del Pino, a nobleman from Bologna and a doctor and lecturer in ecclesiastical law at the university there, had inherited substantial wealth by the time Catherine writes letter T193 to him. While she mentions that &ldquo;Cristo abbracci&ograve; la povert&agrave; volontaria,&rdquo; she attempts to strike a middle ground with Lorenzo, who must be living like the wretches mentioned in the letter who hate truth. She writes:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Le ricchezze e lo stato del mondo, se l&rsquo;uomo le vuol tenere, il pu&ograve;; e non offende Dio n&eacute; l&rsquo;anima sua; ma se egli le lassasse, sarebbe maggior perfezione, per&ograve; che maggior perfezione &egrave; a lassare che a tenere. Ma s&rsquo;egli non vuole lassare attualmente, debbe lassare e rifiutare col santo desiderio, e non ponere in loro il suo principale affetto, ma solo in Dio; e tenerle per uso a&rsquo; suoi bisogni e della sua famigliae come cosa prestata, e non come cosa sua. Facendo cos&igrave; non riceve pena mai d&rsquo;alcuna cosa creata; perocch&eacute; la cosa che non si possiede per amore, non si perde mai con dolore.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Riches and status in the world do not offend God or the eternal soul, even though it would be more perfect to let these things go. The important aspect of one&rsquo;s relationship with that status and money or possessions is to perceive them as the temporal states and objects that they are. Catherine recommends seeing the prestige and riches as that which is lent to the possessor, rather than that which is owned outright by them. This important relationality, the knowledge that &ldquo;ogni cosa passa,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;serves to redirect vices towards virtues that mediate on a power higher than the self, while also allowing Catherine to make use of these temporal states in her work for the Church (T193). </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Though Catherine lived in poverty by choice and did good works for the poor, Catherine had a large network of support that intersected with well-connected nobility and religious figures, perhaps leaving her with less of an understanding of all the possible realities of others. Towards the end of a letter to a prostitute of Perugia, she writes: &ldquo;E se tu mi dicessi: &laquo;il non avere di che vivere mi ritrae&raquo;; e io ti dico che Dio ti provveder&agrave;&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;(T276). Though we do not know the circumstances of this woman, she likely did not have a choice in the way she chose to support herself. While Catherine states that she hears the prostitute&rsquo;s brother will support her (the letter was written at the request of one of the woman&rsquo;s brothers), clearly the woman in question had not previously had this support, so the implied assistance seems tenuous at best. Though economic imagery is particularly fitting for a prostitute addressee, it seems uneven for Catherine to grant to rich patrons the solace that they are not living in sin despite their wealth, while to a prostitute she does not offer much other than empty words relating that &ldquo;God will provide for you&rdquo; when evidently he has not. To the prostitute as well as to the homosexual in letter T21, Catherine is less tempered and more dogmatic in her condemnation of their particular sins of the flesh, offering them less comfort than she does for those whom are valuable to her cause. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Catherine&rsquo;s use of financial metaphors can make the spiritual more commonplace and quotidian, and perhaps easier for some to understand. As a spiritual woman, Catherine remains outside of city commerce, as she lives more for her future heavenly life than for her current earth-bound one, but her use of monetary language shows her civic-mindedness, as she is employing a tangible financial contract in order to relate spiritual matters to a class of people within an increasingly mercantile society. In utilizing monetary language in letters about spiritual matters, Catherine strikes a careful balance between two often oppositional schools of thought, bringing them to bear on each other in a meaningful way to better teach her readers and remain as a figure embedded within two spheres. Ultimately, this speaks to her positionality as a mystic who is concerned with both this-worldly and other-worldly concerns at once. </span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Catherine&rsquo;s Advice to Women</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">With one-third of her letters addressed to women &mdash; many of whom were fellow </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate </span><span class="c1">&mdash; Catherine is able to take on the role of a spiritual advisor in the manner of a friend, sister, or mother, and able to write in a register that negotiates between the seriousness of the word of God and the playfulness of informal companionship. A series of letters in particular, to Daniella da Orvieto &mdash; </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;vestita dell&rsquo;abito di Santo Domenico,&rdquo; a </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellata</span><span class="c2 c1">, who later attained the state of blessedness, but of whom we do not know many historical details &mdash; are particularly provocative and show the full register of Catherine&rsquo;s writing to women. Daniella is the recipient of four very long and intense letters that were written between the fall of 1378 and early 1380. She appears to be viewed as a spiritual equal by Catherine, though perhaps younger, and seems to have been trying to imitate Catherine&rsquo;s extreme fasting and penance (Noffke 232). Catherine offers advice and guidance to Daniella, as she does to many similar women in terms of health, behavior and voice, but she also presents some contradictory suggestions. As to whether a woman should speak freely, as Catherine did, or resign herself to silence, to Daniella Catherine recommends both. This appeal to both speaking and silence suggests that a female voice must follow a certain paradoxical standard, or may evolve from one approach to the other. Also, though Catherine does tend to emphasize the corporal, with Daniella this is pronounced. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Her first letter to Daniella is T65, believed to have been dated in September or early October 1378. Focusing on the consecrated life, T65 is very similar to a letter written to William Flete (T64) and a section of the </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on &ldquo;Truth.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt43" id="ftnt_ref43">[43]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Each of the letters T64 and T65 follow a parallel structure, but the endings of each are unique and the similar content &ldquo;is used in each letter with quite different intent&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c1 c5">Letters</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;vol. III, 232). In T65 to Daniella, </span><span class="c1">Catherine first mercilessly analyzes the dangers of the ascetic life (though she was clearly a practitioner), then rises to the ardent contemplation of divine love. She discusses two points in particular that she wants Daniella to observe: to be absent of judgmental thoughts of fellow humans, and to understand the importance of a life of mortification (a life that Catherine believes they have both been called to). By the end, however, she writes very personally on her own failings at moderation, &ldquo;Dolgomi io miserabile, che non seguitai mai questa vera dottrina; anco, ho fatto il contrario, e pero mi sento d&rsquo;essere caduta spesse volte in dispiacere e in giudizio del prossimo&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;(T65). Catherine divulges her own difficulties in moderating her practice of penance and in judging others&rsquo; practices, wrongfully having believed that if they were not as self-punishing as she that they were not worthy of divine light. In this way, the letter offers Catherine herself as a human being who is not always a supreme example of spiritual devotion, allowing a personal register alongside her more general and mystical approach to offering guidance.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c2 c1">Although in many ways Catherine of Siena acted as an extremely public figure, she also be worked to harmonize her life in terms of an outside, public-facing life alongside a meditative life of self-imposed private contemplation. Daniella attempted to live extremely ascetically in a self-imposed cloister, following a more traditional expression of female spirituality. Catherine, too, makes use of this trope, and to some of her letter recipients, she addresses the concept of the &ldquo;cell of self-knowledge.&rdquo; For Catherine, this is dualistic in nature as it requires a mental cloistering of the self while going about as a person in the world amid earthly obligations and distractions. In one letter to the Countess Benedetta Salimbeni, this image is particularly lucid. She writes about the planting of the tree of love for God, explaining where it should be planted (T113):</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">La terra &egrave; la vera umilt&agrave; &hellip; e &lsquo;l luogo, dov&rsquo;ella &egrave;, &egrave;&rsquo;l giardino chiuso del cognoscimento di s&egrave;. Dico che &egrave; chiuso, perch&egrave; l&rsquo;anima che sta nella cella del cognoscimento di s&egrave; medesima, ella &egrave; chiusa, e non &egrave; aperta, cio&egrave; che non si diletta nelle delizie del mondo. &hellip; &nbsp;non spande il cuore suo per confusione n&egrave; per tedio di mente&hellip;. Anco si serra e si chiude colla compagnia della speranza e col lume della santissima fede.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c2">This description of self-knowledge as an enclosed garden resonates with the idea of the cloister, but is kept inside oneself, rather than the more traditional and opposite approach of keeping oneself within a cloister. The person who has this garden or cell can lock herself up in it, and not take part in worldly delights, though she is part of the world. By cultivating her own self-knowledge, Catherine was able to maintain a private internal refuge for herself to continue her solitary contemplation of God while publicly doing God&rsquo;s work in the world. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Through living within harmony between public and private, Catherine also advises other women to strike this moderate accord that acknowledges spiritual life but directs energy toward the eternal life. In letter T61 to Monna Agnesa Malavolti and other </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&mdash;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;perhaps Catherine&rsquo;s earliest surviving letter &mdash; Catherine meditates on Saint Agnes of Montepulciano and Mary Magdalen, pointing out the former&rsquo;s holy humility and the latter&rsquo;s passionate &ldquo;drunken&rdquo; love. It is between this dichotomy of saints &mdash; the meek and the fervent &mdash; that Catherine advises the women to behave. She writes, &ldquo;io vi prego e vi comando che voi entriate in questo santissimo mezzo&rdquo; &mdash;&ldquo;I beg you, I command you: enter into this most holy middle,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;or as Tylus interprets it, this &ldquo;balance between the two saints&rdquo; (T61, 197). In either case it is necessary for spiritual women of the 14th century to paradoxically be both a cloistered mystical abbess like Agnes, and a public preacher and converter like the passionate Mary Magdalen. Catherine&rsquo;s own approach to balancing the public and private aspects of her life can be seen as a blend between Agnes and Mary Magdalen, as she worked to cultivate an inner cell and was blessed with intimate visions, while also doing charitable and political work in the world. In this manner, the addressees of this letter should learn to follow each of the saints, and find a proper equilibrium of neither too humble nor too ardent. The mediation between a quiet charity and an impassioned zeal also elucidates Catherine&rsquo;s advice regarding speech. That perhaps her fellow </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;should still the tongue but not too much while also striving to be quite loquacious when speaking God&rsquo;s will.</span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">In her second letter to Daniella, Catherine is explicit regarding the degree of moderation that Daniella must seek to balance worldly and spiritual affairs. This epistle, T213, is dated in mid-October 1378. Like Catherine in her teenage years, Daniella opted to remain in a self-imposed cell. She experienced difficulty due to her asceticism, and found herself very sick due to scoring her body to an unhealthy degree. Though Catherine makes clear that it is within normal spiritual bounds for Daniella to discipline her body so that it may be more compliant, she should not do so if she is weak from illness: &ldquo;Anco, debbe non solamente lassare il digiuno, ma mangi della carne: e se non gli basta una volta il d&igrave;, pigline quattro. Se non pu&ograve; stare in terra, stia in sul letto; se non pu&ograve; inginocchioni, stia a sedere e a giacere, se n&rsquo;ha bisogno.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;The implication here &mdash; that Daniella should not only give up fasting but eat meat, and eat it several times a day, and that she should repose as needed &mdash; indicates that her health is an important aspect of serving God. In this letter it is made clear that she does not expect the same fortitude of others that she expects of herself, and she does not wish others to be in poor health trying to follow her example. When writing to Daniella, we can see a caring and motherly Catherine who offers sound advice to others when they cannot follow the example that she herself puts forth as a mystic who constantly fasts and beats her own body.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c2 c1">The importance of health is central to Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality, as she acted as a force in the world. Those who have been to Siena today may have noticed the escalators that are located throughout the city in order to accommodate easier passage among the steep hills. Catherine, who did good works in her own city and traveled throughout Italy and to France in the 14th century, relied very much on her good health in order to accomplish her acts of community building, political engagement, and promoting the social good. Therefore it is in keeping with Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality to encourage Daniella to get better so that she may bring her entire body to bear on the production of charity. In this same letter, she delineates and dismembers the body to explain how the entire corporal being can be utilized for the word of God (T213):</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">A tutte le membra del corpo d&agrave; ordine, acciocch&eacute; siano modeste e temperate: l&rsquo;occhio non ragguardi dove egli non debbe, ma dinanzi a s&eacute; ponga la Terra, e &lsquo;l Cielo: la lingua fugga il parlare ozioso e vano, e sia ordinata ad annunziare la parola di Dio in salute del prossimo, e confessare i peccati suoi: l&rsquo;orecchia fugga le parole dilettevoli, lusinghevoli, dissolute, edi detrazione, che gli fussero dette; e attenda a udire la parola di Dio, e il bisogno del prossimo, cio&egrave; volontariamente udire la sua necessit&agrave;. Cos&igrave; la mano nel toccare o nello adoperare, i piei nell&rsquo;andare; a tutti d&agrave; regola. E acciocch&eacute; per la perversa legge della impugnazione che d&agrave; la carne contra lo spirito, non si levi a disordinare questi strumenti, pone la regola al corpo, macerandolo con la vigilia, col digiuno, e con gli altri esercizii, i quali hanno tutti a raffrenare il corpo nostro.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">With this letter, which is offered as advice to another, we can infer how Catherine governs her own individual body parts. Though Catherine is loquacious, we must reason that her mouth is tempered to only speak and proclaim the word of God &mdash; never talking idly, as her ears must selectively listen, as her eyes must look to the ground or to the heavens, her feet run, and her hand touch and bring things to fruition. For Catherine, the hand and the tongue must work in harmony, which may be informed by traditional Dominican spirituality as it is consistent with the early preacher Humbert who writes that &ldquo;one should preach not only with his voice, but with all that he is&rdquo; (Tylus 184). Not only must Catherine bring her voice to bear on sharing the word of God, but she must make use of her body as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the tongue in this letter may be of particular interest, as Catherine recommends neither than a woman speak freely nor that she should resign herself to silence &mdash; indeed, she advises that Daniella do both, suggesting that a female voice must follow a certain standard, or may evolve. Though other </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;were certainly engaged in</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;charitable works in hospitals and involved in lay society, Catherine was certainly the most politically and publicly engaged of her group. Her advice to other </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">, from letter T40 written in 1377, addressed to &ldquo;certain of her daughters in Siena,&rdquo; offers another compromise between conversation and choosing not to socialize: &ldquo;che questa purit&agrave; di mente e di corpo non si potrebbe avere con le molte conversazioni delle creature, n&egrave; col ponere l&rsquo;affetto e l&#39;amore nostro in loro n&egrave; in cosecreate, fuori della volont&agrave; di Dio.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Again, there is this emphasis that the withholding of speech should be done when it is not an act that serves God, and that speech is made acceptable when conversations occur within the realm of charity for God. When the </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate </span><span class="c1">care for the ill in the hospital, they are to weep or rejoice with those who weep or rejoice: &ldquo;e godendo con coloro che godono, che sono veri servi di Cristo crocifisso; e sempre dilettarvi della loro conversazione&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;(T40). Catherine identifies two separate kinds of speech, but interestingly she uses the same word &mdash; &ldquo;conversazione&rdquo; &mdash; in both cases, causing the speech done outside of God&rsquo;s love and within God&rsquo;s love to be quite ambiguous. While Catherine can demonstrate that there are two ways to speak, and that women should indeed speak to serve God, women should not speak in all instances.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c2 c1">Letter T213, which is very lengthy within Catherine&rsquo;s corpus at 3,100 words, shifts to focusing more on the body and punishment of the body than it does toward speech acts and the tongue by the end of the text. Though there is a transition, Catherine continues to advise Daniella:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">io invito te e me a fare quello che per lo tempo passato io confesso non avere fatto con quella perfezione ch&rsquo;io debbo. A te non &egrave; intervenuto come a me, cio&egrave; d&rsquo;essere stata e essere molto difettuosa, n&eacute; d&rsquo;essere andata con larghezza di vita, e non con estrema, per lo mio difetto; ma tu, come persona che hai voluta atterrare la gioventudine del corpo tuo, acciocch&eacute; non sia ribello all&rsquo;anima, hai presa la vita estrema per siffatto modo, che pare che esca fuore dell&rsquo;ordine della discrezione</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt51" id="ftnt_ref51">[51]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Paradoxically, Catherine is both esteeming Daniella&rsquo;s commitment to asceticism as being greater than what she herself was able to achieve, and reprimanding Daniella for going beyond discretion. Catherine confesses that she has not been perfect in her complete humility, and she says this in close proximity to addressing again Daniella&rsquo;s body, with the description of it being youthful. Employing the noun &ldquo;gioventudine&rdquo; rather than the adjective &ldquo;giovane,&rdquo; she further emphasizes the idea of youthfulness, and in placing the &ldquo;tuo&rdquo; after &ldquo;corpo,&rdquo; the reader sees &ldquo;gioventudine&rdquo; and &ldquo;corpo&rdquo; in close succession. Despite a tone that is becoming more corporeally concerned, there is still the mother&rsquo;s scolding evident in this letter; the word &ldquo;estrema&rdquo; is used positively, but going out of the confines of discretion is unacceptable. Tylus notes that Catherine &ldquo;cultivated the persona of the &lsquo;mamma&rsquo; (perhaps partially to guard against sexual overtones of her relationships with young men her age),&rdquo; so this wavering between a maternal and more sexualized tone is not limited to Daniella in particular or her female companions general (117</span><span class="c1">).</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The concern with the body coupled with the advice and even scolding of Daniella shows that Catherine has a special relationship with the young woman that differs in tone from many of her more friendly letters to other </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">In early November 1378, Catherine writes to Daniella in anticipation of a visit to Orvieto on her way to Rome. In this letter, she continues to offer advice to Daniella, explaining to her that she understands the tension between what the young woman is perceiving God is telling her to do, and what other religious are advising her to do. She encourages Daniella to respond to what she feels called to, and notes that both herself and Daniella enjoy being in the special light of God. This letter is full of literary symbols &mdash; though it was </span><span class="c2 c1">common in the Middle Ages to liken the Christ to a book, it is not often that we see two women in correspondence to each other discussing this. We know that both women are reading and writing as Catherine mentions a letter that she recently received from Daniella, showing again the community of literate women around her. Explaining the rule of eternal Truth, Catherine writes:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">&hellip; scrissela nel corpo suo con lettere s&igrave; grosse, che veruno e di si basso intendimento che si possa scusare; non con inchiostro, ma col sangue suo. Bene vedi tu i capoversi di questo libro, quanto essi sono grandi&hellip;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt52" id="ftnt_ref52">[52]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">In this imagery, Catherine touches on the common tropes of Christ as parchment, his blood as ink, and the concept of God as author. Though this would likely be familiar imagery to people of this time, it is remarkable that it is written in the context of one women to another. This letter assumes a familiarity with books, and with large initials that would be contained in expensive manuscripts, suggesting that both Daniella and Catherine had some form of access or knowledge about books and their design. The diction around books and literacy moves into Catherine&rsquo;s recommendation for Daniella to follow her own sensibilities, empowering her to not listen to those who she may wrongly think know more than she does, which seems validated after considering Daniella&rsquo;s knowledge of books, writing, and the eternal Truth of God. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of the letter, Catherine provides Daniella with more advice, telling her not to sleep, to not be negligent, to be humble, and to pray continuously:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Non dormiamo pi&ugrave;, destianci dal sonno della negligenzia, mugghiando con umili e continue orazioni sopra il corpo mistico della santa Chiesa, e sopra il vicario di Cristo. Non cessare d&rsquo;orare per lui, che gli dia lume e fortezza a resistere a&rsquo; colpi de&rsquo; dimoni incarnati, amatori di loro medesimi, i quali vogliono contaminare la Fede nostra.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt53" id="ftnt_ref53">[53]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">There is a focus on the mystical body of the Church, which is always rendered as a woman and is grammatically gendered feminine, bringing back a corporeal aspect to the letter. Then there are the fleshy demons who are &ldquo;amatori di loro medesimi,&rdquo; seeking to contaminate the Christian faith. In other letters, Catherine makes use of these two phrases &mdash; the lovers who love themselves and the &ldquo;dimoni incarnati.&rdquo; She typically discusses men who love themselves as being evil and seeking to do harm, as in a letter dated October 5, 1378 to Pope Urban VI: &ldquo;con desiderio di vedervi vestito del vestimento forte dell&rsquo;ardentissima carit&agrave;, acciocch&egrave; li colpi che vi sono gittati dagl&rsquo;iniqui uomini del mondo amatori di loro medesimi, non vi possano nuocere.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Her references to the incarnate demons are equally negative, though she only suggests that they could be likened to the letter recipient or other Christians in T190 to the tailor Francesco di Pipino and his wife Agnesa in late October 1378:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Voglio dunque che a questo abbiate una grande avvertenzia, di sempre conversare con i servi di Dio, e serve; e gli altri e l&#39;altre fuggire come fuoco. E non vi fidatemai di voi, dicendo: &laquo;io son forte, e non temo che questi mi faccia cadere&raquo;. ... Ma con vera umilt&agrave; cognosciamo che, se Dio non ci tiene egli, noi saremmo dimoni incarnati.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">This is to say that associating with those who have no faith can cause God&rsquo;s followers to lapse, even if they think they are strong enough to resist. Catherine makes it clear that without God holding on to us, we would all be devils in the flesh. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">With these images in mind, let us continue to the last letter Catherine writes to Sister Daniella da Orvieto, dated to late 1378 or early 1379, T308</span><span class="c1">. </span><span class="c1">Noffke glosses the tone of this letter as being &ldquo;quite general, except for Catherine&rsquo;s plea for prayer for the Church,&rdquo; but I believe it is unusual in its use of diction, though Noffke translates some of the distinctive phrases in a different manner (</span><span class="c1 c5">Letters</span><span class="c1">, Vol. IV, p. 64). Throughout this letter there is a focus on beauty, blood, and love. She uses the word &ldquo;bellezza&rdquo; five times in the first third of the letter, and she only uses the word &ldquo;bellezza&rdquo; in 54 of her letters total (just under 14% of her corpus of letters). The beauty she sees in Daniella is in her soul, innocence, and within &ldquo;his creature&rdquo; &mdash; which could refer to humanity in general or Daniella in particular. She also describes God being &ldquo;ebbro d&rsquo;amore&rdquo; (&ldquo;drunk with love&rdquo;) due to the beauty he finds in his creation, which is a common phrase throughout the </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo </span><span class="c1">(see Chapter 2 above), but only occurs in three of her letters.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;In the last few lines of T308 Catherine invokes the mystical image of bathing and drowning in Christ&rsquo;s blood, which appears in six letters and in some places in the </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo</span><span class="c2 c1">, but she also uses the phrase of Daniella and Catherine being &ldquo;amatori di noi,&rdquo; so similar to how she describes the demons in other letters. She writes:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">B&agrave;guati nel sangue, acciocch&egrave; scrupolo veruno non caggia</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt57" id="ftnt_ref57">[57]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;mai nella mente tua, n&egrave; per timore servile. Ma nascondianci nella caverna del costato di Cristo crocifisso, dove hai trovato l&rsquo;abondanzia del sangue. In altro modo anderemo in tenebre, e saremo amatori di noi. Considerando me che altro modo non c&rsquo;era, dissi ch&rsquo;io desideravo di vederti bagnata e annegata nel sangue di Cristo crocifisso: e cos&igrave; voglio che tu facci. Altro non ti dico. Permani nella santa e dolce dilezione di Dio: abbi fame del suo onore e desiderio. Ges&ugrave; dolce. Ges&ugrave; amore.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt58" id="ftnt_ref58">[58]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">This letter to Daniella seems particularly graphic and corporeal, even for mystical standards, because of its specificity. She discusses the ribcage of Christ &mdash; it is Christ&rsquo;s side and the blood there that correlates to Catherine&rsquo;s mystic vision. Generally, in Catherine&rsquo;s mystical vision as described in Heather Webb&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s Heart,&rdquo; there is the depiction of Catherine and Christ as containers of each other, depending on perspective. In this instance, though, it is Catherine and Daniella who are hiding themselves in the cave of Christ&rsquo;s ribs.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Though she does only mention bathing and drowning in the blood of Christ in six letters, Catherine does use the same imagery in a few instances in the </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">, though sometimes she uses the word &ldquo;annegata&rdquo; in terms of drowning in the will of God rather than in blood. In</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;131 she does explicitly mention drowning and bathing in the blood of Christ, both in the middle and towards the end of the section:</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Passando subito per la porta stretta, che e il Verbo, e poich&eacute; &egrave; annegata nel Sangue, giunge a me, mare pacifico, essendo una stessa cosa io, mare pacifico, e la porta che &egrave; la mia Verit&agrave;, l&rsquo;Unigenito mio Figlio.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt59" id="ftnt_ref59">[59]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip; </span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Passano cos&igrave;, gloriosamente, da questa vita, bagnati nel Sangue, con la fame della salute delle anime, tutti affocati nella carit&agrave; del prossimo, attraverso la porta, che &egrave; il Verbo, ed entrano in me.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt60" id="ftnt_ref60">[60]</a></sup></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">These two descriptions of drowning and bathing, respectively, in the blood of Christ can also be in general terms as it concerns the proverbial &ldquo;every man&rdquo; soul, or the specific soul that belongs to Catherine. Like the letter to Daniella, this imagery can be read rather erotically, as the sea and the gate are joined and made to be one and the same, facilitating the hungry blood-soaked souls to enter into the gate. Christ as gate seems to gender him as feminine in terms of both Italian grammar and in terms of being the open receiver rather than the souls that are pushing through (though these are also gendered feminine). The drowning and bathing imagery is corporeal, eroticm and tends to connote Christ in feminine terms. This is also the case for letter T308 as it is Catherine and Daniella who are inside of Christ who receives them.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c2 c1">When Catherine writes to Daniella, is she hoping to share her mystic qualities with the woman in whom she sees so much of herself? Entering the darkness, Catherine and Daniella, together, will be lovers of themselves, with language identical to the letters that discuss demons who are loving themselves. This can be interpreted as falling under a category of self-love that is in turn love that is directed to God by virtue of the self being God&rsquo;s creation, but it is unusual that demons and wicked men are also engaging in this behavior throughout Catherine&rsquo;s letter corpus. This erotic language is therefore quite ambiguous when considering it alongside Catherine&rsquo;s common tropes. Why is it that she is using this similar language, when it seems obvious that she would not be likening herself or Daniella to sinners in a linguistic way? The diction that includes shadows, hiding, and being lovers of ourselves,suggests that there may be more to their relationship with sin than may be obvious. In this short letter, Catherine soon has nothing more to say to Danella beyond stating that she would like to see the young nun be soaked and drowned in Christ&rsquo;s blood, and wanting Daniella to have &ldquo;hunger&rdquo; for God&rsquo;s honor and desire. Finally, as is customary, she ends the letter with the often employed &ldquo;Ges&ugrave; dolce, Ges&ugrave; amore,&rdquo; returning back to her use of the rhetorical structure of letters.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Erotic overtones are not unusual in medieval mystic writers, and, given that women who pursued religious vocations are said to be the wives of Christ, the eroticism directed towards the divine seems almost natural. Previous medieval writers such as Boccaccio and Heloise, among others, speak to nuns with voracious sexual appetites in their stories and their letters.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt61" id="ftnt_ref61">[61]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Since we have so few texts from women living lives similar to Catherine, and given a context of eroticism in medieval religious literature, perhaps this current of corporeality is merely another transference of orality to textuality. &nbsp;As a bride of Christ, Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality is decidedly erotic at times, and it transfers to her followers &mdash; both female and male &mdash; on occasion. When writing to other women, many of whom were living in a way similar to her own life as </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;who balanced their time between this world and the other world, Catherine conflates and complicates their relationships by being a friend, mother, possible lover, and religious leader, offering advice that would be difficult for anyone to follow due to its paradoxical nature, but in keeping with her own approach to spirituality.</span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4">The Corpus of Letters and Network Analysis</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">[need to incorporate the new network visualizations]</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Using digital network visualization to analyze Catherine&rsquo;s output through her extant letters renders some of the trends of her letter-writing career more obvious. Social network analysis investigates social structures, using nodes (people and things) and the ties that connect them to visualize data. In the visualization below (interactive version online), done in the statistical programming language R and the JavaScript D3 library, the nodes are comprised of letter recipients and letters, and the curved lines represent links between and among letters and their respective recipients. The nodes here are rendered as names of the recipients in text, and the letters are referred to by numbers as used in the Noffke edition of the letters. Time is also represented in this visualization, moving clockwise from the top with letter T61 and Agnesa Malavolti and the </span><span class="c1 c5">Mantellate </span><span class="c2 c1">(likely written before the plague of the summer of 1374), and follow through to letter T373 (written to Raymond of Capua on February 15, 1380), the break of which can be seen through the orientation of the text describing those nodes. Note that &ldquo;Raimondo da Capua&rdquo; does not appear next to letter T373, this is because recipients appear in chronological order based on the first instance that Catherine writes to them. When hovering over the name of a letter, the recipient(s) and the tie connecting the letter to the recipient(s) is rendered in a red-orange color, making it readily apparent which letters are being written to a single addressee, and which are addressed to a non-collective group. When hovering over the name of a recipient, the relevant letters addressed to him or her are displayed in a violet color, immediately displaying how many letters that recipient received, and whether the letters were clustered throughout Catherine&rsquo;s letter-writing activity or if they were limited to a particular time period. </span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 382.00px; height: 382.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image00.png" style="width: 382.00px; height: 382.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c18"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lisatagliaferri.com/flare.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1485760729869000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2PfhiDasnFKGYlgUJdsqmtBHVag">http://lisatagliaferri.com/flare.html</a></span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ties connecting letters and recipients will cluster more dramatically to certain recipients, it becomes more obvious who are the most important nodes in Catherine&rsquo;s written output. Though one would expect Catherine&rsquo;s confessor, Raymond of Capua, to play a significant role throughout her letter production (and we do have 16 extant letters addressed to him), a lot of activity can be seen with respect to some other recipients: Monna </span><span class="c1">Agnesa</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span class="c1">, wife of the Florentine tailor Francesco di Pipino (and with whom she shares some addressed letters); Bartolomeo Dominici, a Dominican friar, sometimes confessor, travel companion, and who provides a testimony in the </span><span class="c1 c5">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c1">; Neri di Landoccio Pagliaresi, a Sienese nobleman and poet, disciple, scribe, and eventual hermit, who was responsible for the earliest gathering and dissemination of Catherine&rsquo;s correspondence. Clustering around the times when they served as pope, Gregory XI received 14 extant letters between </span><span class="c1">1375</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;and 1377, showing the extent of Catherine&rsquo;s work to bring him back to Rome, with about 70% of the extant letters sent prior to his decision to return. Pope Urban VI received eight extant letters between 1378 and 1380, revealing a continued literary-based outreach and spirituality on Catherine&rsquo;s part after her great achievement of convincing Gregory XI to return to Rome. The Queen of Naples, Giovanna d&rsquo;Angi&ograve;, received seven extant letters between late 1374 and 1380, exemplifying Catherine&rsquo;s political involvement that persisted throughout, and likely drove her letter writing career at least in part. </span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 401.44px; height: 441.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image07.png" style="width: 401.44px; height: 441.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c18"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://caterina.io/network.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1485760729873000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE80IqlS9bzTWtMrm2KDs7ZCZe_oA">http://caterina.io/network.html</a></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the network diagram above, done in JavaScript and the D3 library, Catherine is the red node in the center connected to various groups shown in light blue, with various intersections for each group. The dark blue group at the top are the lay people in her network, including figures like Niccol&ograve; di Toldi, who she comforted during his execution, and the tailor Francesco di Pipino and his wife Agnesa from Pisa. Moving clockwise, the pink nodes are part of a family cluster, and the purple nodes are part of a </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cluster, both of which include the orange node of Lapa, Catherine&rsquo;s mother who was both a family member and later became a member of Catherine&rsquo;s order.

These three women, who were educated as members of the nobility, were instrumental to Catherine&rsquo;s learning to read and write.

Between the nobility on the bottom right and the orange cluster of the religious on the bottom left are some more overlaps, including Giovanni della Celle, a Benedictine priest at Vallombrosa, and </span><span class="c1">Tora di Piero Gambacorta</span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><span class="c1">, a Dominican who accompanied Catherine to Avignon. Another hybrid node, </span><span class="c2 c1">Francesco di Messer Vanni Malavolti, is rendered in green because he was a nobleman during Catherine&rsquo;s life and became a Benedictine later, showing how Catherine&rsquo;s persuasiveness continued to resonate with those in her network even after her death.

Her husband who was also included as an addressee with Agnesa, received 11 total. The person who received the most letters, as one may expect, was Catherine&rsquo;s confessor Raymond, who was the recipient of 16 letters total. In terms of total number of letters, Pope Gregory XI came in second place, having received 14 letters from Catherine. With the diagram divided by groups, we can see that the religious group received the most letters, with lay and noble more equal in distribution. Men also received more letters than women did, and many individual men were frequent recipients of Catherine&rsquo;s epistles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professions that Catherine interacted with are visualized in the following bubble diagram, that breaks down the groups by religious orders (Benedictines including an inner circle of abbots, Dominicans, including an inner circle of </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c2 c1">, Augustinians, Franciscans, and Carthusians), other abbots, priests, archbishops, cardinals, popes of the Holy See, and the non-religious (poets, lecturers, lawyers, notaries, military, politicians, and titled nobility). </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 588.50px; height: 691.52px;"><img alt="" src="images/image01.png" style="width: 588.50px; height: 691.52px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c18"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://caterina.io/bubbles.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1485760729880000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBlMOC5A5YXOp79K-l6-zYg6oNmg">http://caterina.io/bubbles.html</a></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">In the diagram it is clear that the Dominicans is the largest group that Catherine interacted with, but it is significant to see that she is well-connected among politicians and religious people who are of high rank, like cardinals. Catherine also enjoyed network connections to other professionals such as lawyers, lecturers and notaries, and even enjoyed the company of the poets Giannozzo di Benci Sacchetti and Neri di Landoccio Pagliaresi.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final visualization shows Catherine&rsquo;s letter activity over time to three groups: religious, noble, and lay. Over the course of the period of Catherine&rsquo;s letter-writing career, spanning from 1374 through 1380 (the year of her death), we see the amount of letters proliferate between the years of 1377 and 1379. The dip in letters in 1376 is the year that Catherine traveled as ambassador to Avignon. Catherine only wrote five letters in 1380; two to Pope Urban VI, and three to Raymond of Capua, with the last two dated February 15, a few months before Catherine died on April 29.&nbsp;What is particularly interesting is that the letters to the nobility continue to increase overtime until 1380, with three letters written to noblemen in 1374, nine in 1375, 10 in 1376, 13 in 1377, 26 in 1378, and 34 in 1379. This suggests that Catherine has a greater need to write to these connections over time as she becomes more politically involved and needs greater support in terms of powerful interlocutors and perhaps financial backing. It also suggests that she was able to build her network of these well-connected individuals as her reputation grew. </span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 422.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image08.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 422.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c18"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://caterina.io/steamgraph.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1485760729883000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwcsWzxIz84FjH9fSmBZP7oJuGPA">http://caterina.io/steamgraph.html</a></span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of the correspondents with whom Catherine wrote were scribes, translators, writers and orators, collectors of her writing, and attested to her sanctity, Catherine successfully developed a literary network around herself. The community-building nature of Catherine&rsquo;s outreach and expression of religiosity are evidenced in the archive of letters that we have extant today. Of the nearly 400 letters that remain, 46.2% of the letters were addressed to more than one recipient. That is, for almost half of the letters that Catherine wrote, she intended more than one recipient, whether it was a group of the </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">, a Sienese political group, or a husband and wife (as with the letters addressed to Francesco di Pipino, a Florentine tailor, and his wife Monna Agnesa). By writing to the plural </span><span class="c1 c5">voi</span><span class="c2 c1">, Catherine is consciously spreading her writing, connecting with many more recipients and getting more value and potential outreach for a single letter. Though there are some instances when she writes similar letters to different recipients (as when she writes to people she does not know well), she is more often writing to recipients who are already connected to each other, tapping into a community that connects through and radiates around her. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 593.81px; height: 365.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image04.png" style="width: 813.12px; height: 365.50px; margin-left: -219.32px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c2 c1">Indeed, Catherine works to further develop this community as the majority (73.7%) of her correspondents are the recipients of more than one letter over the course of her letter writing career. The remaining 26.3% of her extant letters are written to recipients who only received one known letter from Catherine, which in many cases is indicative of a one-off requirement of Catherine&rsquo;s, as when she wrote to a prostitute from Perugia on behalf of the prostitute&rsquo;s brother (T276). In other cases the recipients may have in fact received more than one letter but they are no longer extant. This is likely the case in letter T151b, which is no longer decipherable beyond the title of &ldquo;Frate&rdquo; for its having been overwritten so much. The overwriting is, however, indicative of a continued literary engagement with Catherine&rsquo;s texts, as people continue to interact with these physical objects that were collected and maintained to testify to Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality as well as her productive writing career. With all of this in mind, when considering the circular network diagram, it is important to realize that it is Catherine of Siena who is at the center of this network, serving as the connecting force among all of these recipients and letters.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 519.15px; height: 334.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image03.png" style="width: 744.16px; height: 334.50px; margin-left: -225.01px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Among the people in her community of literary exchange were female friends and disciples including Alessa dei Saracini, Francesca di Clemente Gori (often referred to by her nickname &ldquo;Cecca&rdquo;), Giovanna dei Pazzi, and Giovanna di Capo, who also served as her earliest scribes and who are recipients of several of her letters. Alessa dei Saracini, a young woman of a noble family who took the habit of Saint Dominic, served as a travel companion to Catherine and also offered her house in Siena as a place of refuge for her outside of the crowded Benincasa household. As a noblewoman, Alessa was educated at least in the vernacular language, and taught Catherine to read Italian (</span><span class="c1">Noffke</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c1 c5">Vision Through A Distant Eye</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;40). These women, including other female recipients of letters, are indicative of a female literacy throughout Italy and beyond, and also point to a literary network of women in the vernacular language. Though many of these women likely did not read and write in Latin due to their being precluded from masculine discourse, they were still capable at creating this broader community of written discourse and exchange in Italian.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 592.50px; height: 383.15px;"><img alt="" src="images/image02.png" style="width: 859.69px; height: 383.15px; margin-left: -267.19px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though women serve as a significant part of her community, they make up about a third of her letter correspondence, with men comprising the bulk of the recipients of her letters. This is likely due to women&rsquo;s lack of access to education, but also speaks to Catherine&rsquo;s ability to penetrate the more exclusive masculine religious community of her time, and how she did so through adept written exchange. During a time when the vast majority of Italian spiritual women were considered to be &ldquo;witches&rdquo; or otherwise transgressive in some way (King </span><span class="c1">145</span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><span class="c1">), Catherine was able to persuasively and successfully advocate for her authentic mystical experiences and knowledge of God. An instrumental figure in asserting and maintaining Catherine&rsquo;s reception and legacy was her confessor and advisor from 1374 on, Raymond of Capua (Raimondo della Vigne da Capua). Destined for a legal career and student of law at the University of Bologna, Raymond instead chose to enter into the Dominican Order while still a student in 1350. First assigned to Montepulciano, he served as chaplain to nuns of the Dominican Second Order in the monastery there. Agnes of Montepulciano, a former prioress of this monastery, was highly regarded by the community, and Raymond became her first biographer when he wrote of her life about 50 years after her death. Clearly, as someone educated in law and someone who was writing hagiography even before his encounter with Catherine, Raymond was a person who realized the power of writing. And in fact this early writing did eventually prove to be fruitful as Agnes was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726. Raymond was sent next to Rome and then to Siena, where the Master General assigned him to be the spiritual director and confessor to Catherine of Siena, who was already a notable figure by the time Raymond began to work with her, and she in turn helped his career by causing him to be noticed by the pope. Because of his important relationship to her, Raymond received a large amount of letters from Catherine, including letters that describe important turning points in her life, including when she describes learning to write by her own hand (T272), and when she recounts the execution of Perugian Niccol&ograve; di Toldo in 1375 (T273). Becoming the Master General of the Dominican Order in the year of Catherine&rsquo;s death, he worked on the authoritative </span><span class="c1 c5">viva</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of her life between 1385 and 1395. The result of this work, a hagiographical work that is known as the </span><span class="c1 c5">Legenda maior</span><span class="c2 c1">, would establish itself as the most influential biographical work on Catherine.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">Among her male scribes were her disciples Francesco di Messer Vanni Malavolti, Neri di Landoccio Pagliaresi and Stefano di Corrado Maconi. Francesco, who was first a married nobleman then became a Benedictine, received only one extant letter of Catherine&rsquo;s. He provided testimony for the </span><span class="c1 c5">Processo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c5">Castellano</span><sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><span class="c1">, a document written compiled in the beginning of the 15th century and which proved to be instrumental to the canonization of Catherine. Neri, as discussed above, received many of Catherine&rsquo;s letters, and had served to be an important correspondent for Catherine as he helped to secure her literary legacy through collecting and disseminating a group of her letters. Stefano was also responsible for a collection of Catherine&rsquo;s letters. A member of the lesser nobility of Siena and a travel companion, like Francesco he also provided one of the 24 testimonies to the </span><span class="c1 c5">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c2 c1">, and entered the Carthusian Order after Catherine&rsquo;s death. With two scribes among the men who collected Catherine&rsquo;s letters for posterity, as well as two who beared witness to her saintly acts, it is clear that her scribes greatly respected Catherine&rsquo;s good works and writing, honoring the latter through maintaining and circulating it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the other correspondents of hers who provided testimony for the </span><span class="c1 c5">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are Bartolomeo Dominici, a Dominican friar, sometimes confessor and travel companion who received nine extant letters from Catherine; Martino, Abbot of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Michele in Passignano, who received two extant letters; Pietro di Giovanni Ventura, an early disciple who was converted by Catherine to become a Dominican friar and served as Catherine&rsquo;s emissary and also received two extant letters. Tommaso d&rsquo;Antonio da Siena, also known as Caffarini, was a very important figure in Catherine&rsquo;s life and her afterlife. Responsible for beginning work on the </span><span class="c1 c5">Processo Castellano </span><span class="c1">through the solicitation of testimonies, and providing a testimony himself, Caffarini also campaigned to seek papal approval of the Dominican </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and worked to develop and legitimize the saintly cult around Catherine of Siena (Ferzoco). A native of Siena, devoted follower of Catherine, and the director of the Sienese </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in the year of her death, Caffarini proved to be extremely influential in promoting reform within the Dominican order, receiving recognition for the </span><span class="c1 c5">mantellate</span><span class="c1">, cultivating Catherine&rsquo;s cult and verifying her sanctity (</span><span class="c1">Parsons</span><sup><a href="#cmnt10" id="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;16). Together with Raymond of Capua, Caffarini is responsible for much of the hagiographical writing about Catherine in the decades after her death. Creating an abbreviated version of Raymond&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1 c5">Legenda maior</span><span class="c1">, called the </span><span class="c1 c5">Legenda minor</span><span class="c1">, and he also wrote the much longer </span><span class="c1 c5">Libellus de Supplemento</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;to include additional biographical as well as hagiographical details about Catherine. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cristofano di Gano Guidini, a follower of Catherine&rsquo;s who did not fully commit to a religious life, choosing instead to marry and have children, served sometimes as a scribe for Catherine, according to Caffarini, and most importantly rendered her </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo </span><span class="c1">into Latin (Luongo, </span><span class="c1 c5">Saintly Politics</span><span class="c1">, 136). A Sienese notary who was active in politics, Cristofano was aware of what was required to gain legitimacy through text distribution in contemporary Europe. Though Catherine exercised control over her texts through use of the Sienese vernacular, Cristofano and Raymond &mdash; who wrote his </span><span class="c1 c5">Legenda maior</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in Latin &mdash; and more than likely Catherine herself, realized that Latin translation would be necessary to realize true circulation of her writing. Were it not for this Latin translation by the notary Cristofano, who was also a writer of his own autobiography, the </span><span class="c1 c5">Libro di memorie</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;which includes vivid recounts of his relationship with Catherine, the </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo </span><span class="c2 c1">likely would not have been later translated into Middle English for the nuns of the Syon Abbey. Though Catherine would always assert that spiritual priorities were more important ones, including in her letters to Cristofano, she likely understood that his political involvement was an important node of her larger network, and his spirituality proved to be more civic in nature, particularly in his devotion to the Spedale della Scala. Indeed, F. Thomas Luongo reads Catherine&rsquo;s tone in her letters to him not necessarily as reproachful, but suggests that it is only &ldquo;affectionate mocking of a follower whom she knew to be committed only so far&rdquo; (137). I believe that it is Cristofano&rsquo;s &ldquo;civic piety,&rdquo; as Luongo calls it, which leads to Cristofano taking action with the translation of Catherine&rsquo;s book, as he ensures that the educated elite and those with political power can read it and take it seriously.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine, however, also exerted her own power over the afterlife of her texts, by entrusting her writing into the hands of Giovanni Tantucci, one of her early followers. A priest and scholar, likely educated at Cambridge along with William Flete, Giovanni was convinced by Catherine to &ldquo;renounce his comfortable worldly life as a priest and dedicate himself to the ascetic life&rdquo; as early as 1365 (Russell 79). He became part of the Augustinian hermit community of </span><span class="c1">Lecceto</span><span class="c1">, and Catherine probably was provided access to this network through Giovanni. She would continue to correspond with this network frequently throughout her letter writing career (</span><span class="c1">Jorgensen</span><sup><a href="#cmnt11" id="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;146). Because of this long history, and likely because of his scholastic approach to religiosity, she had a great deal of respect for him and she entrusted him with her writings including her letters before her death (Noffke). He absolved her on her deathbed, and also delivered her eulogy. While Caffarini suggests that he was at a loss for words, his taking on the duties of her absolution and funerary oration indicates that he took care of her afterlife in every sense of the word, including of her work. </span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1">In her last letter, written to Raymond, Catherine entrusts the </span><span class="c1 c5">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in particular to four men; the addressee along with Bartolomeo de&rsquo; Dominici, Tommaso della Fonte and the &ldquo;Master&rdquo; Giovanni Tantucci (</span><span class="c1">T373</span><sup><a href="#cmnt12" id="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup><span class="c2 c1">):</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1">Anco vi prego che il libro e ogni scrittura la quale trovaste di me, voi e frate Bartolomeo e frate Tomaso e il Maestro, ve le rechiate per le mani; e fatene quello che vedete che sia pi&ugrave; onore di Dio, con missere Tomaso insieme: nel quale io trovava alcuna recreazione.

This letter, explicitly dated February 15, 1380 in three manuscripts, is very likely her last dictated letter, written the same day as T371, which was also written to Raymond, but done in her own hand. What I would like to highlight here is that for Catherine her writing and her greater community are thought about nearly simultaneously &mdash; for her, this is her legacy, and she cares about what happens to both her writing and her </span><span class="c1 c5">famiglia</span><span class="c1">. In requesting that several of her followers be responsible for her book and whatever other writing they can find, she ensures that there are several guardians to keep track of her archives. She has found &ldquo;recreazione&rdquo; in them, from the Latin &ldquo;recreare&rdquo; as in &ldquo;create again, renew,&rdquo; which would have been used similarly in Old French. In Middle English, &ldquo;recreation&rdquo; was more indicative of &ldquo;mental or spiritual consolation.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt63" id="ftnt_ref63">[63]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Italian etymology shows that </span><span class="c1 c5">ricreare</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;deals with a sense of &ldquo;rianimare&rdquo; alongside rebuilding and restoration, but also with the joy that comes after the strain of rebuilding: &ldquo;ogni sorta di piacevolezze per distrarre l&rsquo;animo.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt64" id="ftnt_ref64">[64]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;If we think of her writing as a re-creation, it speaks to the reforms that she began to make in the Dominican Order as well as in her special kind of spirituality that engages with the community through good works and writing, and it can also speak to the reflection and the pleasure that can be found after doing this work. Together with her greater network, her </span><span class="c1 c5">famiglia</span><span class="c2 c1">, Catherine is able to spread the commitment to reform as well as the joy that can be found in recreating. </span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><div><p class="c15 c19"><span class="c2 c9 c13"></span></p></div><hr class="c23"><div><p class="c7"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;[Catherine] had attracted followers, to whom she had communicated her insights in friendship in hundreds of letters, in her prayer as she meditated aloud in their presence, and in the book she had written as a summary of her teaching for them and others like them.
