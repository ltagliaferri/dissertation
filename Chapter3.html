This chapter will consider the connections that Catherine made in her lifetime that are illuminated historically through her letter production, as well as analyze the strategic and rhetorical nature of her letters. Catherine&rsquo;s letters are </span><span class="c1">persuasive, evocative, and lyrical</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c1">, and serve as a material extension of her spirituality and </span><span class="c1">political engagement</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c1">, as well as markers of the many friendships she formed and nurtured throughout her life. Collected along with her </span><span class="c0">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;after her death, the letters were published first in a small collection of 31 letters printed by Fontanesi (Bologna, 1492), and were later followed by an edition of 353 letters printed by Aldo Manuzio (Venice, 1500) (</span><span class="c1">Cavallini</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;xiv).</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">In his book </span><span class="c0">The Art of the Network: Strategic Interaction and Patronage in Renaissance Florence</span><span class="c1">, Paul D. McLean discusses the role that letters play in building and sustaining relationships in 15th-century Italy. As a sociologist, he reflects broadly on how social interactions shape the lives of individuals, and how individuals are defined by those around them (1-2):</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">Our careers are made &mdash; and we are made &mdash; through our interactions with others, as well as through the performance of those tasks to which we have access by virtue of our connections to others. We become more fully the persons we are through interaction, our personhood being constructed out of a number of different identities we adopt, singly or in combination, in different interactional settings. We may achieve autonomy, and achieve a private conception of self independent of attributions of identity put upon us by others, through the accumulation of multiple network ties and participation in social interaction coursing across multiple networks and diverse cultural domains.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">A daughter of a wool-dyer father, Catherine grew up in a non-noble family that had some ties to religious professions. Despite her status as a 14th-century woman, Catherine managed to interact with people of high position through her persuasive writing (and speech acts)</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c1">, spirituality, and commitment to the social good. In her interactions across multiple networks &mdash; the lay, religious, and nobility &mdash; and through diverse cultural domains that extended beyond her home city of Siena. Her career &mdash; which included the roles of mystic, writer, ambassador, and what we may anachronistically call social worker &mdash; &nbsp;was largely successful due to the formation of her social ties. Though historically we cannot fully examine all the historical temporal-based works that she did to develop the network around her, the collection of her letters that we have provide an indication of the remarkable life that she negotiated for herself.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Catherine&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;letter-writing career begins before 1374 and extends to February 15, 1380, about two months before her death at the age of 33. Her letters were addressed to men and women geographically located throughout Siena, Tuscany, and beyond the Italian peninsula. Today we have 386 of her letters extant, though these are not wholly intact, as &ldquo;inspiration and edification were the purposes of those who were preparing the letters for dissemination, [with] all that was purely personal or informational [being] irrelevant&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c0">Letters</span><span class="c1">, xxv). The versions of the letters that we have are based primarily on a canonization project, and today we only have the </span><span class="c0">original</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;transcriptions of eight of the letters (Noffke, </span><span class="c0">Letters</span><span class="c1">, xxii). Though we cannot be certain that we have access to some form of all the letters that she wrote, nor can we be sure that these letters are written and copied as Catherine intended as there were many opportunities for alterations,</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;I agree with Noffke&rsquo;s assertion that &ldquo;There is little cause &hellip; to question the essential authenticity of the text as we have it, even though it is not in Catherine&rsquo;s own hand&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c0">Letters</span><span class="c1">, xxiii). This collection of letters, therefore, provides a revealing glimpse into Catherine&rsquo;s historical reality and serves as a document of her literary power. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Though Catherine opted to use the Italian language throughout her writing and correspondence (as discussed above), her reach crossed linguistic barriers and into greater Europe through letters to the Avignon papal court; Charles V, King of France and his brother Louis, Duke of Anjou; Louis the Great and Elizabeth of Hungary. The heatmap of Catherine&rsquo;s recipients (Fig. 1), which takes into account the known locations of letter recipients (308 of the total), shows how Catherine&rsquo;s output radiates from Siena, reaches to the north and to the south, and trickles into Europe. This is also reflective of some of the travels that Catherine made during her lifetime, throughout Tuscany, to Avignon and to Rome. The spread of her letters does not speak only to geographical diversity, but to linguistic variety as well. Italian, a relatively new vernacular language, was even more formally varied at the time of Catherine&rsquo;s writing than it is in contemporary dialects today, as the language developed and clustered throughout what would become Italy. Catherine&rsquo;s recipients within Italy did not consist solely of native Italian speakers, as she wrote to the Englishmen William Fleet and John Hawkwood while both in Italy, the French-born Pope Gregory XI in his travel to and settlement in Rome, and many of her bilingual educated male correspondents may have been more accustomed to writing in Latin rather than Italian, especially as a lingua franca. </span></p><p class="c7 c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 584.10px; height: 353.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image05.png" style="width: 584.10px; height: 353.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7 c15"><span class="c1">Fig. 1, interactive online version: </span><span class="c1 c8"><a class="c16" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/CatherineLetterMap&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1472532613867000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGytuLk78SPcRHbxW3TMpLQXDZusA">http://bit.ly/CatherineLetterMap</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Catherine&rsquo;s adeptness at cultivating her network probably began with her decision to join the </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a</span><span class="c1">t about 18 years old, as it was a tertiary group that allowed her access to the Dominican Order while also providing her with relative autonomy as a lay practitioner. While in Pisa in 1375 on a diplomatic mission working to sway Pisa and Lucca in favor of the papacy, Catherine began to write letters frequently and in a manner that would continue to be developed throughout her letter writing career which persisted for the rest of her life. F. Thomas Luongo notes (</span><span class="c0">Saintly Politics</span><span class="c1">, 81)</span><span class="c1">,</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">Catherine&rsquo;s letters from Pisa reveal an increasingly intense preoccupation with the dispute and its threat to church unity, and develop what was to become a familiar theme in her letters to secular and clerical leaders: a three-pronged program for peace in Italy and the church, consisting of the interdependent goals of Crusade, return of the pope to Rome, and ecclesiastical reform.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">What is particularly noteworthy about Catherine&rsquo;s letters, is that they present to us a literate community of women from the 14th century, material echoes of exchange between </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and other women who wrote letters to each other in absence or to offer advice and spiritual guidance. </span><span class="c1">Of her letters that survive, one-third of them were written to women, proving the significance of her relationships with women, as well as her esteem of them, as she chooses to not only address the pope, political leaders and her confessors in her letters, but the women belonging to her order as well as those from different classes. The female community she belonged to was also significant in the propagation of her letters, as they were her first scribes. The dispersal of Catherine&rsquo;s letters therefore establishes a group of women capable of reading and writing in the vernacular and, though this was not considered to be literacy in a Latinate world, reveals the community-based education attained by these individuals. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">More than negotiating the various intricacies of a classed society, the letters Catherine wrote also negotiated the public and private realms of her cultural context, writing on both political and spiritual matters, often to public figures, but in the intimate medium of the personal letter. Letters to the Pope, Catherine must have known, would not have been read solely by him, and indeed the personal letters arrived with a public performance, as Raymond sent an accompanying messenger to Pope Gregory XI in order to interpret, </span><span class="c0">viva voce</span><span class="c1">, Catherine&rsquo;s Italian words into Latin (Tylus 161). Her letters were also often written in a communal manner with fellow </span><span class="c0">Mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;nearby and serving as her scribes, as in T204 addressed to Bartolomeo Dominici, which shows community and jocularity at once: &ldquo;Dice Alessia grassotta, che voi preghiate Dio per lei e per me, e per Cecca perditrice di tempo.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Catherine&rsquo;s acts of mediation are further embodied by the language registers she employs in the texts of the letters themselves. F. Thomas Luongo observes that Catherine (74) </span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">mixes elements of high formality (for example, the superpapal self-identification as &ldquo;servant and slave of the servants of Jesus Christ&rdquo;) with a chatty style typical of a personal letter (for instance, the informal and simple closing, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say more,&rdquo; a typical element of Tuscan secular and mercantile letters). The tone of Catherine&rsquo;s letters is not popular or colloquial, but frequently strikes a lofty and prophetic register; nevertheless, consistent with the style of the personal letter, he language is her own Sienese vernacular, immediate and familiar, a &ldquo;low&rdquo; form of language. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Through mixing registers between her opening and closing statements, Catherine shows her relative ease with negotiating a more learned rhetorical approach indicative of a public document with the features of a textual conversation between friends. And, as Jane Tylus has demonstrated, and as letters such as T204 and others in which the scribe refers to herself as &ldquo;Giovanna pazza&rdquo; reveal (T144, T152, &nbsp;T208), Catherine mixes her serious religious guidance with &ldquo;small shreds of gossip and conversation&rdquo; (33). Catherine mixes orality of chattiness with a strict and consistent formality, &ldquo;Al nome di Ges&ugrave; Cristo crocifisso e di Maria dolce. Carissimo figliuolo in Cristo dolce Ges&ugrave;. Io Catarina, serva e schiava de&rsquo; servi di Ges&ugrave; Cristo, scrivo a voi nel prezioso sangue suo; con desiderio di vedervi ardere nella fornace della divina Carit&agrave; &hellip;&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(as in T236 to Bartolo Usimbardi, for instance). The formal openings to all her letters almost always follow this formula: 1) invoking Christ and Mary, 2) referring to the addressee as her dearest son or daughter in Christ, 3) referring to herself as the servant and slave of Christ, 4) stating that she writes to the recipient in the precious blood of Christ, 5) stating what she desires to see the addressee do. These openings show Catherine&rsquo;s adhering to the literary genre of the letter, following closely the example of papal letters, and rhetorically positioning herself as a humble servant who then tells her correspondant what she wants for them to do. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">While the letters themselves are personalized correspondence typically tailored to an individual, she sometimes tells her recipients, or messenger-scribes to share the letters with others by passing along or reading aloud, so that a wider audience may benefit (Tylus 190, 201). </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Indeed, as Karen Scott notes, Catherine&rsquo;s letters often discuss a &ldquo;main virtue which she wishes her correspondents to understand and practice better&hellip;&rdquo; demonstrating that her letters can be situated in a wider spiritual discourse applicable to many (100). Her request to preserve not just her </span><span class="c0">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but her &ldquo;other writings&rdquo; as well </span><span class="c1">affirms that Catherine is aware of the textual legacy of her letters and believes that the work will continue to serve God by reaching any living people.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c18">Financial Language in the Letters</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1 c18"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine&rsquo;s letters prove to be quite pragmatic and aware of her readership, providing worldly language, and monetary language in particular, as a means to drive home spiritual teachings. Though one may expect that monetary analogies to be most effective with a lay and noble audience, Catherine also employs economic analogies when writing letters addressed to religious recipients. As Catherine and her contemporaries were living during a time when the mercantile class was flourishing, trade was increasing, and written language was becoming more accessible to the general population (i.e., the rise of the vernacular in Europe), commercial and monetary concerns touched a greater portion of society. This blending of the spiritual and the earthly shows a careful negotiation of mixed signs that can at times seem contradictory, especially as Catherine&rsquo;s teachings encourage poverty. The letters to nobles in particular must achieve a prudent balance in an effort to be complimentary to those who are likely providing some financial or political support to herself, and theological teachings that favor poverty over riches. </span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 512.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image01.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 512.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">In 39 letters, 15 of which were written to women, Catherine uses the economic metaphor o</span><span class="c1">f &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;a word that Catherine also uses in the </span><span class="c0">Dialogo</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and which</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Suzanne Noffke explains &ldquo;has the sense of a down payment, a pledge of future payment in full&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0">The Dialogue</span><span class="c1">, 68). The 1612 edition of the </span><span class="c0">Vocabolario dell&rsquo;Accademia della Crusca</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(Venezia) provides the following definition for the word </span><span class="c0">arra</span><span class="c1">: &ldquo;propriamente parte di pagamento della mercatantia pattuita, che si da al creditore per sicurt&agrave;, laquale, in caso, la mercatantia non si volesse, si perde.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;The word therefore has a sense of a deposit, a payment installment, or a guarantee that the item will be paid in full at a future point in time. In her letters, Catherine uses the phrases &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra d&rsquo;inferno&rdquo; (&ldquo;a down payment on hell&rdquo;) and &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna,&rdquo; (&ldquo;down payment on the eternal life&rdquo;) most frequently, with just &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra&rdquo; used twice and &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra della morte eternale&rdquo; used once to Raymond.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;In the chart above, we can see that she uses the phrase &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna&rdquo; most often for male religious, and more so for men than for women throughout each class (religious, noble, and lay), respectively. Women were far more likely to receive the phrase &ldquo;l&rsquo;arra d&rsquo;inferno,&rdquo; except for in the case of female religious. Catherine is therefore much more likely to tell women that they are making a down payment on hell while telling men that they are making a down payment on the eternal life in paradise. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Striking a parallel between financial language and spiritual matters is not original, but Catherine uses this analogy frequently. The Latin Vulgate version (the one Catherine would have been familiar with) of the Epistle to the Ephesians (the tenth book of the New Testament) includes the passage </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;qui est pignus hereditatis nostrae in redemptionem adquisitionis in laudem gloriae ipsius&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">(Ephesians 1:14)</span><span class="c1">.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Both &ldquo;pignus&rdquo; and &ldquo;adquisitionis&rdquo; have economic connotations, with &ldquo;pignus&rdquo; referring to a pledge (or security for debt) or a mortgage, and &ldquo;adquisitionis&rdquo; referring to an acquisition.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Following the canonical text of the Bible ensures that Catherine is not using language that is far removed from tradition, which could serve to protect her as a woman writing about spiritual matters. As neither of the Latin words used in Ephesians are a cognate for &ldquo;arra,&rdquo; it is worth noting that Dante does use this word in </span><span class="c0">Purgatorio</span><span class="c1">: &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Lo sommo Ben, che solo esso a s&eacute; piace, / f&eacute; l&rsquo;uom buono e a bene, e questo loco / diede per </span><span class="c1 c18">arr&rsquo; a lui d&rsquo;etterna pace</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; (28, 91-93, emphasis mine).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dante uses this language in the passage narrated by Matilda in the earthly paradise, where she gives the historical context of Eden and explains that &ldquo;the high Good&rdquo; paid a down payment to man for eternal peace. Even predating Dante, is the work of female mystic Angela da Foligno, whose Latin text, often referred to as her &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Libro</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; (as with Catherine&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">), also uses the word &ldquo;arra,&rdquo; &ldquo;Studeamus igitur sustinere tribulationes temporales cum patientia, immo &amp; cum gaudio. In eis enim signum recipimus, quod sumus dilecti &amp; electi ab amato, &amp; </span><span class="c1 c18">recipimus arram suae haereditatis</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; (Angela da Foligno,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Angela de Fulginio</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;390).</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Angela is obviously referring to the Epistle to the Ephesians, which may indicate that in oral language people were substituting the word &ldquo;arra&rdquo; for &ldquo;pignus&rdquo; in 13th- and 14th-century Italy. Even if this were not the case, the use of the common word of &ldquo;arra&rdquo; suggests again that there is an exchange between mystical and poetic writing, as writers in both genres are using this specific financial word to write about spirituality. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Writing to Don Giovanni dalle Celle, a Vallombrosan whom she met at his hermitage outside Florence in 1374, Catherine explains that those who are full of love for God taste the down payment they make on the eternal life, while those who direct love to themselves taste the deposit they make on hell (T322):</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">Non gli &egrave; duro il portare pena n&egrave; fadiga; anco gli &egrave; diletto, perch&egrave; con odio santo ha abbandonato s&egrave; medesimo, onde riluce in lui la virt&ugrave; della pazienza, con le sue sorelle, cio&egrave; fortezza e longa perseveranzia. Questi gusta l&rsquo;arra di vita eterna: siccome quegli che stanno nell&#39;amore proprio,gustano l&rsquo;arra dell&#39;inferno; perch&egrave; sono fatti incomportabili a loro medesimi, amando disordinatamente s&egrave; e le creature e le cose create.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">The letter, believed to be dated shortly after December 13, 1378, is the second letter she has addressed to Don Giovanni dalle Celle, and in it, she encourages him to join the council of the servants of God that Urban VI had invited him to in Rome. The letter deals with the theme of charity, which she refers to as a &ldquo;dolce madre&rdquo; (&ldquo;sweet mother&rdquo;), and she explains that she is sure that if his love was consumed in the oven of divine charity he will certainly leave behind his selfish love, but she constructs her letter to suggest that his responding positively to the invitation from the pope is a kind of test of this love:</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">Or m&rsquo;avvedr&ograve; se voi sarete amatori di Dio e della reformazione di santa Chiesa, e se voi non ragguarderete alle proprie consolazioni. Son certa che, se voi averete consumato l&#39;amore proprio in questa fornace, voi non curerete d&rsquo;abbandonare la cella e le vostre consolazioni; ma piglierete la cella del cognoscimento di voi, e con essa verrete a ponere la vita, se bisogner&agrave;, per la verit&agrave; dolce. Altrimenti, no. E per&ograve; vi dissi ch&rsquo;io desideravo di vedere consumato ogni amore proprio di voi nella fornace della divina carit&agrave;.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">As one of her &ldquo;staunchest defenders,&rdquo; Don Giovanni dalle Celle was likely living the life consistent with what Catherine describes as being a lover of God, but in this letter she is setting out to ensure that he will dedicate himself to reform the Church (Noffke, </span><span class="c0">Letters</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Vol. IV, 35). By setting up the financial dichotomy between those who direct their love towards God in the act of divine charity, and those who direct their love inwards towards selfish comforts, Catherine is able to emphasize that these choices serve as deposits on the eternal life.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving as a patron and disciple to Catherine, Ristoro di Piero Canigiani was a learned lawyer as well as a leading Guelf in Florence. The son of Piero Canigiani and older brother of Barduccio, he served in a political capacity on behalf of Florence in dealings with Queen Giovanna of Naples and Gregory XI. Catherine first writes to support him through the Revolt of the Ciompi, a rebellion of unrepresented laborers that began in Florence in 1378. The houses of prominent Guelfs &mdash; considered to be enemies of the people &mdash; were looted and burned around June 22, 1378, and his house and his father&rsquo;s were among those that were damaged. His father was also exiled from the city. Catherine does not explicitly mention these events in her first letter to Ristoro, T299, but mentions a tragic event in his life, causing Noffke to date this to July 1378 (</span><span class="c0">Letters</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;III, 160). In this letter, she discusses how loving material goods is problematic, because those are only loaned to us, and we will be parted with those goods either during life (when God wills it), or when we die. If people love with sensual love, and with love of the world and its pleasures, people make down payments on hell, as she mentions twice in this single letter:</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Questo &egrave; quello miserabile amore che tolle il lume della ragione, e non lassa cognoscere la verit&agrave;; tolle la vita della Grazia, e dacci la morte; tolleci la libert&agrave;, e facciservi e schiavi del peccato, che &egrave; quella cosa che non &egrave;: onde in questa vita gusta l&rsquo;arra dell&rsquo;inferno.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">Egli &egrave; fatto incomportabile a s&egrave; medesimo: onde gusta l&rsquo;arra dell&rsquo;inferno; per&ograve; che il vermine della coscienzia sempre rode. </span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">What is significant in these instances is that Catherine contextualizes the love of money and possessions with the idea of a down payment, striking a very apt parallel that can prove to be effective for those in the noble class, especially at a time when they are suffering from having lost many of their earthly possessions. Catherine&rsquo;s letter continues to explain that the love of God, which can be manifested in acts of charity, is a love that cannot be taken away as sensual love can. She writes, &ldquo;E per&ograve; questi cotali di neuna cosa possono avere pena, perocch&egrave; hanno posto l&rsquo;amore e l&rsquo;affetto in quella cosa che non gli pu&ograve; essere tolta,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;insisting that those who order their lives around God: acting with integrity in marriage, raising children to love God, and doing works of charity, will suffer no pain because love and affection cannot be taken away from them.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">258:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sometime after [Letter T299] she received a letter from him in which he apparently told her of his efforts at reforming his life.

Among this list she writes:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&ldquo;La virt&ugrave; gli &egrave; tanto piacevole, che dell&#39;uomo virtuoso egli ne fa un altro s&egrave; per affetto dolce d&#39;amore; e in questa vita gli fa gustare l&#39;arra di vita eterna: che stando nel mare tempestoso delle molte fadighe e amaritudini, gusta la pace e la dolcezza.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Shift from down payment on hell to down payment on eternal life, pledge of eternal life -- from God?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">In some cases she renders the image even more explicit, adding the verb &ldquo;to pay,&rdquo; as when she addresses the Queen of Naples, stating &ldquo;cominci&ograve; a pagarci l&rsquo;arra, per darci pienamente speranza del pagamento&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(T143). This is to say that Christ begins making a downpayment for humanity through his crucifixion, but individuals are still required to continue the payment to ensure their eternal lives. This use of monetary language shows Catherine&rsquo;s civic-mindedness, as she is employing a tangible financial contract in order to relate spiritual matters to a class of people within an increasingly mercantile society.</span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">In addition, she explicitly calls two letter recipients a &ldquo;debitore,&rdquo; including a homosexual whose name was since scratched out. Using similar language to the down payment, but instead constructing it as a debt, she writes, &ldquo;renderemo il debito che dobbiamo rendere a Dio. Sappiate che se voi nol rendeste, voi cadereste nella pi&ugrave; scura prigione che si possa immaginare&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(T21). This man, whom she addresses in the formal </span><span class="c0">voi</span><span class="c1">, must confess and hold his sin in contempt to return his debt. Of course, this is not entirely without reference to a Scriptural basis, as she echoes Mark 12:17 when she tells the homosexual to give to God what is his and to the earth what is the earth&rsquo;s (give to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s), but her choice of words and repetition shows her position as a public figure. As Cheryl Forbes notes, &ldquo;Catherine&rsquo;s images here &hellip; are earthly, not heavenly; they are concrete, not abstract&rdquo; (135). Using language that conjures the economic realm, Catherine is able to appeal to non-religious figures in words that they can easily relate to as metaphors for what is at stake in their spiritual lives.</span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Despite her economic language, and though she herself lived in poverty by choice, Catherine had a large network of support that intersected with many of the nobility, and she may not have fully realized the realities of others. Towards the end of a letter to a prostitute of Perugia, she writes: &ldquo;E se tu mi dicessi: &laquo;il non avere di che vivere mi ritrae&raquo;; e io ti dico che Dio ti provveder&agrave;&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(293). While she states that she hears the prostitute&rsquo;s brother will support her, clearly the woman in question had not previously had this support, so the implied assistance seems tenuous at best. Due to Catherine&rsquo;s immersion in public life, as well as her upbringing in an artisanal class, she readily employs economic imagery, which is particularly fitting for her prostitute addressee, but as a spiritual woman, she remains outside of city commerce, as she lives more for her future heavenly life than for her current earth-bound one.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Catherine&rsquo;s use of financial metaphors can make the spiritual more commonplace and quotidian, and perhaps easier for some to understand, but also speaks to her positionality as a mystic who is concerned with both this-worldly and other-worldly concerns at once. In utilizing monetary language in letters about spiritual matters, Catherine strikes a careful balance between two often oppositional schools of thought, bringing them to bear on each other in a meaningful way to better teach her readers and remain as a figure embedded within two spheres. </span></p><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">&ldquo;God permits us to have wealth so that we may be its administrators for the poor.

A series of letters in particular, to Daniella da Orvieto &mdash; </span><span class="c1">&ldquo;vestita dell&rsquo;abito di Santo Domenico,&rdquo; a </span><span class="c0">mantellata</span><span class="c1">, who later attained the state of blessedness, but of whom we do not know many historical details &mdash; are particularly provocative and show the full register of Catherine&rsquo;s writing to women. Daniella is the recipient of four very long and intense letters that were written between the fall of 1378 and early 1380. She appears to be viewed as a spiritual equal by Catherine, though perhaps younger, and seems to have been trying to imitate Catherine&rsquo;s extreme fasting and penance (Noffke 232). Catherine offers advice and guidance to Daniella, as she does to many similar women in terms of health, behavior and voice, but she also presents some contradictory suggestions. As to whether a woman should speak freely, as Catherine did, or resign herself to silence, to Daniella, Catherine recommends both, suggesting that a female voice must follow a certain standard, or may evolve. Also, though Catherine does tend to emphasize the corporal, with Daniella, this is pronounced. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Her first letter to Daniella (T65) is a letter on the consecrated life, which mimics a letter written to William Flete (T64) and a section of the </span><span class="c0">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on &ldquo;Truth,&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;though the end of each letter is unique and the similar content &ldquo;is used in each letter with quite different intent&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c0">Letters</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;vol. III, 232). In this letter</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Catherine first mercilessly analyzes the dangers of the ascetic life, then rises to the ardent contemplation of divine love. She discusses two points in particular that she wants Daniella to observe: to be absent of judgmental thoughts of fellow humans, and the importance of a life of mortification (a life that Catherine believes they have both been called to). By the end, however, she writes very personally on her own failings at moderation, &ldquo;Dolgomi io miserabile, che non seguitai mai questa vera dottrina; anco, ho fatto il contrario, e pero mi sento d&rsquo;essere caduta spesse volte in dispiacere e in giudizio del prossimo&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(T65). Catherine divulges her own difficulties in moderating her practice of penance and in judging others&rsquo; practices, wrongfully having believed that if they were not as self-punishing as she that they were not worthy of divine light. In this way, the letter offers Catherine herself as a human being who is not always a supreme example of spiritual devotion, allowing a personal register alongside her more general and mystical approach to offering guidance.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">In her second letter to Daniella (T213), Catherine is even more explicit regarding the degree of moderation she must seek. Like Catherine in her teenage years, Daniella opted to remain in a self-imposed cell. She experienced difficulty due to her asceticism, and found herself very sick due to scoring her body to an unhealthy degree. Though Daniella should certainly discipline her body so that it may be more compliant, she should not do so if she is weak from illness, she should refrain: &ldquo;Anco, debbe non solamente lassare il digiuno, ma mangi della carne: e se non gli basta una volta il d&igrave;, pigline quattro. Se non pu&ograve; stare in terra, stia in sul letto; se non pu&ograve; inginocchioni, stia a sedere e a giacere, se n&rsquo;ha bisogno.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Here, we can see a caring and motherly Catherine who offers sound advice to others when they cannot follow the example that she herself puts forth as a mystic who constantly fasts and beats her own body.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The importance of health is central to Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality, as she acted as a force in the world. Those who have been to Siena today may have noticed the escalators that are located throughout the city in order to accommodate easier passage among the steep hills. Catherine, who did good works throughout her own city and traveled throughout Italy and to France in the 14th century, relied very much on her good health in order to accomplish her acts of community building, political engagement, and promoting the social good. Therefore is in keeping with Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality to encourage Daniella to get better so that she may bring her entire body to bear on the production of charity. In this same letter, she delineates and dismembers the body to explain how the entire corporal being can be utilized for the word of God (T213):</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">A tutte le membra del corpo d&agrave; ordine, acciocch&eacute; siano modeste e temperate: l&rsquo;occhio non ragguardi dove egli non debbe, ma dinanzi a s&eacute; ponga la Terra, e &lsquo;l Cielo: la lingua fugga il parlare ozioso e vano, e sia ordinata ad annunziare la parola di Dio in salute del prossimo, e confessare i peccati suoi: l&rsquo;orecchia fugga le parole dilettevoli, lusinghevoli, dissolute, edi detrazione, che gli fussero dette; e attenda a udire la parola di Dio, e il bisogno del prossimo, cio&egrave; volontariamente udire la sua necessit&agrave;. Cos&igrave; la mano nel toccare o nello adoperare, i piei nell&#39;andare; a tutti d&agrave; regola. E acciocch&eacute; per la perversa legge della impugnazione che d&agrave; la carne contra lo spirito, non si levi a disordinare questi strumenti, pone la regola al corpo, macerandolo con la vigilia, col digiuno, e con gli altri esercizii, i quali hanno tutti a raffrenare il corpo nostro.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">With this letter, which is offered as advice to another, we can infer how Catherine governs her own individual body parts. Though Catherine is loquacious, we must reason that her mouth is tempered to only speak and proclaim the word of God &mdash; never talking idly, as her ears must selectively listen, as her eyes must look to the ground or to the heavens, her feet run, and her hand touch and bring things to fruition. For Catherine, the hand and the tongue must work in harmony, as an early Dominican preacher, Humbert, narrates (Tylus).</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the tongue in this letter may be of particular interest, as Catherine recommends neither than a woman speak freely nor that he should resign herself to silence &mdash; indeed, she advises that Daniella do both, suggesting that a female voice must follow a certain standard, or may evolve. Though other </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;were certainly engaged in</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;charitable works in hospitals andinvolved in lay society, Catherine was certainly the most politically and publicly engaged of her group. Her advice to other </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">, from letter T40 written in 1377, addressed to &ldquo;certain of her daughters in Siena,&rdquo; offers another compromise between conversation and choosing not to socialize: &ldquo;che questa purit&agrave; di mente e di corpo non si potrebbe avere con le molte conversazioni delle creature, n&egrave; col ponere l&#39;affetto e l&#39;amore nostro in loro n&egrave; in cosecreate, fuori della volont&agrave; di Dio.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Again, there is this emphasis that the withholding of speech should be done when it is not speech that serves God, for when conversations occur within the realm of charity for God, it becomes acceptable speech. When the </span><span class="c0">mantellate </span><span class="c1">care for the ill in the hospital, they are to weep or rejoice with those who weep or rejoice: &ldquo;e godendo con coloro che godono, che sono veri servi di Cristo crocifisso; e sempre dilettarvi della loro conversazione&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;(T40). Catherine identifies two separate kinds of speech, but interestingly she uses the same word, &ldquo;conversazione,&rdquo; in both cases, causing the speech done outside of God&rsquo;s love and within God&rsquo;s love to be quite ambiguous. While Catherine can demonstrate that there are two ways to speak, and that women should indeed speak to serve God, women should not speak in all instances.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">[continue discussion of Catherine&rsquo;s letters to Daniella]</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">In a letter to Monna Agnesa Malavolti and other </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">, perhaps Catherine&rsquo;s first letter that survives, Catherine meditates on Saint Agnes of Montepulciano and Mary Magdalen, pointing out the former&rsquo;s holy humility and the latter&rsquo;s passionate &ldquo;drunken&rdquo; love. It is between this dichotomy of saints &mdash; the meek and the fervent &mdash; that Catherine advises the women to behave. She writes, &ldquo;I beg you, I command you: enter into this most holy middle [my trans],&rdquo; or as Tylus interprets, this &ldquo;balance between the two saints&rdquo; &ldquo;io vi prego e vi comando che voi entriate in questo santissimo mezzo&rdquo; (T61, 197). Thus, the addressees should learn to follow each of the saints, and by finding a correct equilibrium of neither too humble nor too ardent. The mediation between a quiet charity and an impassioned zeal also elucidates Catherine&rsquo;s advice regarding speech. That perhaps her fellow mantellate should still the tongue but not too much and to be quite loquacious when speaking God&rsquo;s will.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Although Catherine of Siena seems to be an extremely public figure, she may also be harmonizing her own public/outside life with a private contemplation. To some of her letter recipients, she addresses the concept of the &ldquo;cell of self-knowledge,&rdquo; that is, having a cloister oneself while being a person of the world. In one letter to the Countess Benedetta Salimbeni, this image is particularly lucid. She writes about the planting of the tree of love for God, explaining where it should be planted (T113):</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">La terra &egrave; la vera umilt&agrave; &hellip; e &#39;l luogo, dov&#39;ella &egrave;, &egrave;&#39;l giardino chiuso del cognoscimento di s&egrave;. Dico che &egrave; chiuso, perch&egrave; l&#39;anima che sta nella cella del cognoscimento di s&egrave; medesima, ella &egrave; chiusa, e non &egrave; aperta, cio&egrave; che non si diletta nelle delizie del mondo. &hellip; &nbsp;non spande il cuore suo per confusione n&egrave; per tedio di mente&hellip;. Anco si serra e si chiude colla compagnia della speranza e col lume della santissima fede.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">This description of self-knowledge as an enclosed garden resonates with the idea of the cloister, but is kept inside oneself. The person who has this garden or cell can lock herself up in it, and not take part in worldly delights, though she is part of the world. By cultivating her own self-knowledge, Catherine was able to maintain a private internal refuge for herself to continue her solitary contemplation of God while publicly doing God&rsquo;s work in the world. By living within this harmony between public and private, Catherine also advises other women to strike this moderate accord.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c18">The Corpus of Letters and Network Analysis</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">[need to incorporate the new network visualizations]</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Using digital network visualization to analyze Catherine&rsquo;s output through her extant letters renders some of the trends of her letter-writing career more obvious. Social network analysis investigates social structures, using nodes (people and things) and the ties that connect them to visualize data. In the visualization below (interactive version online), done in the statistical programming language R and the JavaScript D3 library, the nodes are comprised of letter recipients and letters, and the curved lines represent links between and among letters and their respective recipients. The nodes here are rendered as names of the recipients in text, and the letters are referred to by numbers as used in the Noffke edition of the letters. Time is also represented in this visualization, moving clockwise from the top with letter T61 and Agnesa Malavolti and the </span><span class="c0">Mantellate </span><span class="c1">(likely written before the plague of the summer of 1374), and follow through to letter T373 (written to Raymond of Capua on February 15, 1380), the break of which can be seen through the orientation of the text describing those nodes. Note that &ldquo;Raimondo da Capua&rdquo; does not appear next to letter T373, this is because recipients appear in chronological order based on the first instance that Catherine writes to them. When hovering over the name of a letter, the recipient(s) and the tie connecting the letter to the recipient(s) is rendered in a red-orange color, making it readily apparent which letters are being written to a single addressee, and which are addressed to a non-collective group. When hovering over the name of a recipient, the relevant letters addressed to him or her are displayed in a violet color, immediately displaying how many letters that recipient received, and whether the letters were clustered throughout Catherine&rsquo;s letter-writing activity or if they were limited to a particular time period. </span></p><p class="c7 c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 382.00px; height: 382.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image00.png" style="width: 382.00px; height: 382.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7 c15"><span class="c1 c8"><a class="c16" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lisatagliaferri.com/flare.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1472532613940000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEiibI8mj9giLrrsWwlzlKUf_mzNg">http://lisatagliaferri.com/flare.html</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ties connecting letters and recipients will cluster more dramatically to certain recipients, it becomes more obvious who are the most important nodes in Catherine&rsquo;s written output. Though one would expect Catherine&rsquo;s confessor, Raymond of Capua, to play a significant role throughout her letter production (and we do have 16 extant letters addressed to him), a lot of activity can be seen with respect to some other recipients: Monna </span><span class="c1">Agnesa</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span class="c1">, wife of the Florentine tailor Francesco di Pipino (and with whom she shares some addressed letters); Bartolomeo Dominici, a Dominican friar, sometimes confessor, travel companion, and who provides a testimony in the </span><span class="c0">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c1">; Neri di Landoccio Pagliaresi, a Sienese nobleman and poet, disciple, scribe, and eventual hermit, who was responsible for the earliest gathering and dissemination of Catherine&rsquo;s correspondence. Clustering around the times when they served as pope, Gregory XI received 14 extant letters between </span><span class="c1">1375</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;and 1377, showing the extent of Catherine&rsquo;s work to bring him back to Rome, with about 70% of the extant letters sent prior to his decision to return to Rome. Pope Urban VI received eight extant letters between 1378 and 1380, revealing a continued literary-based outreach and spirituality on Catherine&rsquo;s part after her great achievement of convincing Gregory XI to return to Rome. The Queen of Naples, Giovanna d&rsquo;Angi&ograve;, received seven extant letters between late 1374 and 1380, exemplifying Catherine&rsquo;s political involvement that persisted throughout, and likely drove her letter writing career at least in part. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of the correspondents with whom Catherine wrote were scribes, translators, writers and orators, collectors of her writing, and attested to her sanctity, Catherine successfully developed a literary network around herself. The community-building nature of Catherine&rsquo;s outreach and expression of religiosity are evidenced in the archive of letters that we have extant today. Of the nearly 400 letters that remain, 46.2% of the letters were addressed to more than one recipient. That is, for almost half of the letters that Catherine wrote, she intended more than one recipient, whether it was a group of the </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">, a Sienese political group, or a husband and wife (as with the letters addressed to Francesco di Pipino, a Florentine tailor, and his wife Monna Agnesa). By writing to the plural </span><span class="c0">voi</span><span class="c1">, Catherine is consciously spreading her writing, connecting with many more recipients and getting more value and potential outreach for a single letter. Though there are some instances when she writes similar letters to different recipients (as when she writes to people she does not know well), she is more often writing to recipients who are already connected to each other, tapping into a community that connects through and radiates around her. </span></p><p class="c7 c15"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 593.81px; height: 365.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image04.png" style="width: 813.12px; height: 365.50px; margin-left: -219.32px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Indeed, Catherine works to further develop this community as the majority (73.7%) of her correspondents are the recipients of more than one letter over the course of her letter writing career. The remaining 26.3% of her extant letters are written to recipients who only received one known letter from Catherine, which in many cases is indicative of a one-off requirement of Catherine&rsquo;s, as when she wrote to a prostitute from Perugia on behalf of the prostitute&rsquo;s brother (T276). In other cases the recipients may have in fact received more than one letter but they are no longer extant. This is likely the case in letter T151b, which is no longer decipherable beyond the title of &ldquo;Frate&rdquo; for its having been overwritten so much. The overwriting is, however, indicative of a continued literary engagement with Catherine&rsquo;s texts, as people continue to interact with these physical objects that were collected and maintained to testify to Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality as well as her productive writing career. With all of this in mind, when considering the circular network diagram, it is important to realize that it is Catherine of Siena who is at the center of this network, serving as the connecting force among all of these recipients and letters.</span></p><p class="c7 c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 519.15px; height: 334.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image03.png" style="width: 744.16px; height: 334.50px; margin-left: -225.01px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Among the people in her community of literary exchange were female friends and disciples including Alessa dei Saracini, Francesca di Clemente Gori (often referred to by her nickname &ldquo;Cecca&rdquo;), Giovanna dei Pazzi, and Giovanna di Capo, who also served as her earliest scribes and who are recipients of several of her letters. Alessa dei Saracini, a young woman of a noble family who took the habit of Saint Dominic, served as a travel companion to Catherine and also offered her house in Siena as a place of refuge for her outside of the crowded Benincasa household. As a noblewoman, Alessa was educated at least in the vernacular language, and taught Catherine to read Italian (</span><span class="c1">Noffke</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c0">Vision Through A Distant Eye</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;40). These women, including other female recipients of letters, are indicative of a female literacy throughout Italy and beyond, and also point to a literary network of women in the vernacular language. Though many of these women likely did not read and write in Latin due to their being precluded from masculine discourse, they were still capable at creating this broader community of written discourse and exchange in Italian.</span></p><p class="c7 c15"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 592.50px; height: 383.15px;"><img alt="" src="images/image02.png" style="width: 859.69px; height: 383.15px; margin-left: -267.19px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though women serve as a significant part of her community, they make up about a third of her letter correspondence, with men comprising the bulk of the recipients of her letters. This is likely due to women&rsquo;s lack of access to education, but also speaks to Catherine&rsquo;s ability to penetrate the more exclusive masculine religious community of her time, and how she did so through adept written exchange. During a time when the vast majority of Italian spiritual women were considered to be &ldquo;witches&rdquo; or otherwise transgressive in some way (King </span><span class="c1">145</span><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup><span class="c1">), Catherine was able to persuasively and successfully advocate for her authentic mystical experiences and knowledge of God. An instrumental figure in asserting and maintaining Catherine&rsquo;s reception and legacy was her confessor and advisor from 1374 on, Raymond of Capua (Raimondo della Vigne da Capua). Destined for a legal career and student of law at the University of Bologna, Raymond instead chose to enter into the Dominican Order while still a student in 1350. First assigned to Montepulciano, he served as chaplain to nuns of the Dominican Second Order in the monastery there. Agnes of Montepulciano, a former prioress of this monastery, was highly regarded by the community, and Raymond became her first biographer when he wrote of her life about 50 years after her death. Clearly, as someone educated in law and someone who was writing hagiography even before his encounter with Catherine, Raymond was a person who realized the power of writing. And in fact this writing proved to be fruitful as Agnes was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726. Raymond was sent next to Rome and then to Siena, where the Master General assigned him to be the spiritual director and confessor to Catherine of Siena, who was already a notable figure by the time Raymond began to work with her, and she in turn helped his career by causing him to be noticed by the pope. Because of his important relationship to her, Raymond received a large amount of letters from Catherine, including letters that describe important turning points in her life, including when she describes learning to write by her own hand (T272), and when she recounts the execution of Perugian Niccol&ograve; di Toldo in 1375 (T273). Becoming the Master General of the Dominican Order in the year of Catherine&rsquo;s death, he worked on the authoritative </span><span class="c0">viva</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of her life between 1385 and 1395. The result of this work, a hagiographical work that is known as the </span><span class="c0">Legenda maior</span><span class="c1">, would establish itself as the most influential biographical work on Catherine.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Among her male scribes were her disciples Francesco di Messer Vanni Malavolti, Neri di Landoccio Pagliaresi and Stefano di Corrado Maconi. Francesco, who was first a married nobleman then became a Benedictine, received only one extant letter of Catherine&rsquo;s, also provided testimony for the </span><span class="c0">Processo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Castellano</span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup><span class="c1">, a document written compiled in the beginning of the 15th century and instrumental to the canonization of Catherine. Neri, as discussed above, received many of Catherine&rsquo;s letters, and had served to be an important correspondent for Catherine as he helped to secure her literary legacy through collecting and disseminating a group of her letters. Stefano was also responsible for a collection of Catherine&rsquo;s letters. A member of the lesser nobility of Siena and a travel companion, like Francesco he also provided one of the 24 testimonies to the </span><span class="c0">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c1">, and entered the Carthusian Order after Catherine&rsquo;s death. With two scribes among the men who collected Catherine&rsquo;s letters for posterity, as well as two who beared witness to her saintly acts, it is clear that her scribes greatly respected Catherine&rsquo;s good works and writing, honoring the latter through maintaining and circulating it.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the other correspondents of hers who provided testimony for the </span><span class="c0">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are Bartolomeo Dominici, a Dominican friar, sometimes confessor and travel companion who received nine extant letters from Catherine; Martino, Abbot of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Michele in Passignano, who received two extant letters; Pietro di Giovanni Ventura, an early disciple who was converted by Catherine to become a Dominican friar and served as Catherine&#39;s emissary and also received two extant letters. Tommaso d&rsquo;Antonio da Siena, also known as Caffarini, was a very important figure in Catherine&rsquo;s life and her afterlife. Responsible for beginning work on the </span><span class="c0">Processo Castellano </span><span class="c1">through the solicitation of testimonies, and providing a testimony himself, Caffarini also campaigned to seek papal approval of the Dominican </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and worked to develop and legitimize the saintly cult around Catherine of Siena (Ferzoco). A native of Siena, devoted follower of Catherine, and the director of the Sienese </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in the year of her death, Caffarini proved to be extremely influential in promoting reform within the Dominican order, receiving recognition for the </span><span class="c0">mantellate</span><span class="c1">, cultivating Catherine&rsquo;s cult and verifying her sanctity (</span><span class="c1">Parsons</span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;16). Together with Raymond of Capua, Caffarini is responsible for much of the hagiographical writing about Catherine in the decades after her death. Creating an abbreviated version of Raymond&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">Legenda maior</span><span class="c1">, called the </span><span class="c0">Legenda minor</span><span class="c1">, and he also wrote the much longer </span><span class="c0">Libellus de Supplemento</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to include additional biographical as well as hagiographical details about Catherine. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cristofano di Gano Guidini, a follower of Catherine&rsquo;s who did not fully commit to a religious life, choosing instead to marry and have children, served sometimes as a scribe for Catherine, according to Caffarini, and most importantly rendered her </span><span class="c0">Dialogo </span><span class="c1">into Latin (Luongo, </span><span class="c0">Saintly Politics</span><span class="c1">, 136). A Sienese notary who was active in politics, Cristofano was aware of what was required to gain legitimacy through text distribution in contemporary Europe. Though Catherine exercised control over her texts through use of the Sienese vernacular, Cristofano and Raymond &mdash; who wrote his </span><span class="c0">Legenda maior</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in Latin &mdash; and more than likely Catherine herself, realized that Latin translation would be necessary to realize true circulation of her writing. Were it not for this Latin translation by the notary Cristofano, who was also a writer of his own autobiography, the </span><span class="c0">Libro di memorie</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;which includes vivid recounts of his relationship with Catherine, the </span><span class="c0">Dialogo </span><span class="c1">likely would not have been later translated into Middle English for the nuns of the Syon Abbey. Though Catherine would always assert that spiritual priorities were more important ones, including in her letters to Cristofano, she likely understood that his political involvement was an important node of her larger network, and his spirituality proved to be more civic in nature, particularly in his devotion to the Spedale della Scala. Indeed, F. Thomas Luongo reads Catherine&rsquo;s tone in her letters to him not necessarily as reproachful, but suggests that it is only &ldquo;affectionate mocking of a follower whom she knew to be committed only so far&rdquo; (137). I believe that it is Cristofano&rsquo;s &ldquo;civic piety,&rdquo; as Luongo calls it, which leads to Cristofano taking action with the translation of Catherine&rsquo;s book, as he ensures that the educated elite and those with political power can read it and take it seriously.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine, however, also exerted her own power over the afterlife of her texts, by entrusting her writing into the hands of Giovanni Tantucci, one of her early followers. A priest and scholar, likely educated at Cambridge along with William Flete, Giovanni was convinced by Catherine to &ldquo;renounce his comfortable worldly life as a priest and dedicate himself to the ascetic life&rdquo; as early as 1365 (Russell 79). He became part of the Augustinian hermit community of Lecceto, and Catherine probably was provided access to this network through Giovanni, and she would continue to correspond with this network frequently throughout her letter writing career (</span><span class="c1">Jorgensen</span><sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;146). Because of this long history, and likely because of his scholastic approach to religiosity, she had a great deal of respect for him and she entrusted him with her writings including her letters before her death (Noffke). He absolved her on her deathbed, and also delivered her eulogy. While Caffarini suggests that he was at a loss for words, his taking on the duties of her absolution and funerary oration suggests that he took care of her afterlife in every sense of the word, including of her work. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">In her last letter, written to Raymond, Catherine entrusts the </span><span class="c0">Dialogo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in particular to four men; the addressee along with Bartolomeo de&rsquo; Dominici, Tommaso della Fonte and the &ldquo;Master&rdquo; Giovanni Tantucci (</span><span class="c1">T373</span><sup><a href="#cmnt10" id="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup><span class="c1">):</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">Anco vi prego che il libro e ogni scrittura la quale trovaste di me, voi e frate Bartolomeo e frate Tomaso e il Maestro, ve le rechiate per le mani; e fatene quello che vedete che sia pi&ugrave; onore di Dio, con missere Tomaso insieme: nel quale io trovava alcuna recreazione.

This letter, explicitly dated February 15, 1380 in three manuscripts, is very likely her last dictated letter, written the same day as T371, which was also written to Raymond, but done in her own hand. What I would like to highlight here is that for Catherine her writing and her greater community are thought about nearly simultaneously &mdash; for her, this is her legacy, and she cares about what happens to both her writing and her </span><span class="c0">famiglia</span><span class="c1">. In requesting that several of her followers be responsible for her book and whatever other writing they can find, she ensures that there are several guardians to keep track of her archives. She has found &ldquo;recreazione&rdquo; in them, from the Latin &ldquo;recreare&rdquo; as in &ldquo;create again, renew,&rdquo; which would have been used similarly in Old French. In Middle English, &ldquo;recreation&rdquo; was more indicative of &ldquo;mental or spiritual consolation.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;Italian etymology shows that </span><span class="c0">ricreare</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;deals with a sense of &ldquo;rianimare&rdquo; alongside rebuilding and restoration, but also with the joy that comes after the strain of rebuilding: &ldquo;ogni sorta di piacevolezze per distrarre l&rsquo;animo.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;If we think of her writing as a re-creation, it speaks to the reforms that she began to make in the Dominican Order as well as in her special kind of spirituality that engages with the community through good works and writing, and it can also speak to the reflection and the pleasure that can be found after doing this work. Together with her greater network, her </span><span class="c0">famiglia</span><span class="c1">, Catherine is able to spread the commitment to reform as well as the joy that can be found in recreating. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Within this same, very lengthy letter, we come upon a paragraph that continues to advise Daniella:</span></p><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c1">io invito te e me a fare quello che per lo tempo passato io confesso non avere fatto con quella perfezione ch&rsquo;io debbo.
