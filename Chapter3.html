This chapter will consider the connections that Catherine made in her lifetime that are illuminated historically through her letter production, setting up the chapter that follows which will analyze the strategic and rhetorical nature of her letters. Catherine&rsquo;s letters are </span><span class="c0">persuasive, evocative, and lyrical</span><span class="c0">, and serve as a material extension of her spirituality and </span><span class="c0">political engagement</span><span class="c2 c0">, as well as markers of the many friendships she formed and nurtured throughout her life. </span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">Collected along with her </span><span class="c0 c7">Dialogo</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;after her death, only eight of the original transcriptions actually sent to their addressees survive (Noffke, &ldquo;The Writings of Catherine of Siena&rdquo; 297): </span></p><ul class="c17 lst-kix_3vslgg9eemov-0 start"><li class="c1 c8"><span class="c2 c0">T298, T320, T329, T332, T319 can be found in Siena&rsquo;s Biblioteca comunale degli Intronati T.III.3</span></li><li class="c1 c8"><span class="c2 c0">T365, T192 can be found at the Church of Santa Lucia in Siena</span></li><li class="c1 c8"><span class="c2 c0">F16 (discovered by Robert Fawtier) is in the Church of Saint Aloysius at Oxford.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">The major manuscripts containing letters that exist are grouped into &ldquo;various &lsquo;families&rsquo; of codices &hellip; suggest[ing] that, at a quite an early stage, individual disciples made small collections of letters that had some personal meaning for them&hellip;&rdquo; (Noffke, &ldquo;The Writings of Catherine of Siena&rdquo; 299). The major families of codices are the Pagliaresi, Maconi and Caffarini, which Noffke describes at length in &ldquo;The Writings of Catherine of Siena: The Manuscript Tradition,&rdquo; pages 296-324. </span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">Caffarini&rsquo;s manuscripts which total 294 letters are the major source of the printed editions, with T.II.2 and T.II.3 at Biblioteca comunale degli Intronati in Siena as the most significant of the group. Comprised of two volumes from the early 15th century, the first volume is no longer fully extant, as pages sent to the Vatican in 1658 have not yet been returned. Today in Siena the collection totals 219 letters, with 80 letters in the first volume and 139 letters in the second volume.</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Caffarini&rsquo;s</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;scriptorium in Venice, which he tasked with propagating Catherine&rsquo;s texts, was the source of this collection. What is most striking about this edition of letters is the degree to which it was illustrated, with 19 full-width drawings in total &mdash; nine (extant) illustrations in the first volume, and ten in the second. With a professional scribe, a very orderly and clean aesthetic, impressive illustrations, and large size, &ldquo;the volumes of letters are in format and script clearly library desk books,&rdquo; and the breadth of the letters forecasted Aldus Manutius&rsquo;s printed edition of Catherine&rsquo;s letters (Luongo &ldquo;Saintly Authorship in the Italian Renaissance&rdquo; 153). As Jeffrey F. Hamburger and Gabriela Signori argue, while Caffarini was not alone in promoting Catherine&rsquo;s canonization, he took a &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo; approach, &ldquo;in which copies and translations of texts play as important a role as images and relics,&rdquo; and I would add that he ties these together through binding image and text together in books (3). The orderly aesthetics of the manuscripts are echoed by the very structured organization of the books that was in keeping with 15th century values.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">Apart from manuscripts, the letters were first printed in a small collection of 31 by Fontanesi in Bologna in 1492 (</span><span class="c0">Cavallini</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;xiv). Aldus Manutius worked from the 294 letters in Caffarini&rsquo;s volumes, and through research found another 74 in various other manuscripts, producing a large print edition of 353 letters in Venice in 1500 (Noffke, &ldquo;The Writings of Catherine of Siena&rdquo; 302). Worth noting is that Aldus Manutius&rsquo;s printing of Catherine&rsquo;s letters &nbsp;predate his editions of Dante and Petrarch, which were completed in 1502 and 1501 respectively. Over time, additional letters were added or new versions were brought to light, with an edition by Girolamo Gigli in 1721 that added 21 letters, Edmund Gardner&rsquo;s 1907 appendix to </span><span class="c0 c7">Saint Catherine of Siena</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;included eight additional letters, Robert Fawtier published two new letters in 1914, and Eugenio Dupr&eacute; Theseider published another two new letters in 1931 raising the current total of letters that we have today to 386 (Noffke, &ldquo;The Writings of Catherine of Siena&rdquo; 303). Today&rsquo;s critical edition of the letters was completed in English translation by Suzanne Noffke. Her four volumes are grouped in chronological order, as much as she was able to do so, which she arranged based on her archival research and through linguistic analysis across the corpus. I have followed Noffke&rsquo;s chronology though the data we have available cannot be absolutely precise. There is no current critical edition of the letters in Italian, though there is a CD-ROM edition of </span><span class="c0 c7">Le Lettere</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;edited by Antonio Volpato available in the larger corpus </span><span class="c0 c7">Santa Caterina da Siena: Opera Omnia</span><span class="c2 c0">, edited by Fausto Sbaffoni and published in Pistoia in 2002. Volpato is currently working on a critical edition with a critical apparatus to be published, though the CD-ROM edition contains Volpato&rsquo;s texts of the letters.</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">In his book </span><span class="c0 c7">The Art of the Network: Strategic Interaction and Patronage in Renaissance Florence</span><span class="c2 c0">, Paul D. McLean discusses the role that letters play in building and sustaining relationships in 15th-century Italy. As a sociologist, he reflects broadly on how social interactions shape the lives of individuals, and how individuals are defined by those around them (1-2):</span></p><p class="c1 c15"><span class="c2 c0">Our careers are made &mdash; and we are made &mdash; through our interactions with others, as well as through the performance of those tasks to which we have access by virtue of our connections to others. We become more fully the persons we are through interaction, our personhood being constructed out of a number of different identities we adopt, singly or in combination, in different interactional settings. We may achieve autonomy, and achieve a private conception of self independent of attributions of identity put upon us by others, through the accumulation of multiple network ties and participation in social interaction coursing across multiple networks and diverse cultural domains.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A daughter of a wool-dyer father, Catherine grew up in a non-noble family that had some ties to religious professions. Despite her status as a 14th-century woman, Catherine managed to interact with people of high position through her persuasive writing (and speech acts)</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">, spirituality, and commitment to the social good. She maintained interactions across multiple networks &mdash; the lay, religious, and nobility &mdash; and through diverse cultural domains that extended beyond her home city of Siena. Her career &mdash; which included the roles of mystic, writer, ambassador, spiritual advisor, and what we may anachronistically call social worker &mdash; was largely successful due to the formation of her social ties. Though today we cannot fully examine all the historical temporal-based works that she did to develop the network around her, the collection of her letters that we have provide an indication of the remarkable life that she negotiated for herself.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">Catherine&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;letter-writing career begins before 1374 and extends to February 15, 1380, about two months before her death at the age of 33. Her letters were addressed to men and women geographically located throughout Siena, Tuscany, and beyond the Italian peninsula. Collected as part of a canonization project, today</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we cannot be certain that we have access to some form of all the letters that she wrote, nor can we be absolutely sure that these letters are written and copied as Catherine intended as there were many opportunities for alterations,</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I agree with Noffke&rsquo;s assertion that &ldquo;There is little cause &hellip; to question the essential authenticity of the text as we have it, even though it is not in Catherine&rsquo;s own hand&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c0 c7">Letters</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;xxiii).</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;This collection of letters, therefore, provides a revealing glimpse into Catherine&rsquo;s historical reality and serves as a document of her literary power. </span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0">Though Catherine opted to use the Italian language throughout her writing and correspondence (as discussed above), her reach crossed linguistic barriers and into greater Europe through letters to the Avignon papal court; Charles V, King of France and his brother Louis, Duke of Anjou; Louis the Great and Elizabeth of Hungary. The heatmap of Catherine&rsquo;s recipients (Fig. 1), which takes into account the known locations of letter recipients (308 of the total), shows how Catherine&rsquo;s output radiates from Siena, reaches to the north and to the south, and trickles into Europe. This is also reflective of some of the travels that Catherine made during her lifetime, throughout Tuscany, to Avignon and to Rome. The spread of her letters does not speak only to geographical diversity, but to linguistic variety as well. Italian, a relatively new vernacular language, was even more formally varied at the time of Catherine&rsquo;s writing than it is in contemporary dialects today, as the language developed and clustered throughout what would become Italy. Catherine&rsquo;s recipients within Italy did not consist solely of native Italian speakers, as she wrote to the Englishmen William Fleet and John Hawkwood while both in Italy, the French-born Pope Gregory XI in his travel to and settlement in Rome, and many of her bilingually educated male correspondents may have been more accustomed to writing in Latin rather than Italian, especially as a lingua franca. </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 584.10px; height: 353.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image07.png" style="width: 584.10px; height: 353.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Fig. 4.

While in Pisa in 1375 on a diplomatic mission working to sway Pisa and Lucca in favor of the papacy, Catherine began to write letters frequently and in a manner that would continue to be developed throughout her letter writing career which persisted for the rest of her life. F. Thomas Luongo notes (</span><span class="c0 c7">Saintly Politics</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;81)</span><span class="c2 c0">,</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2 c0">Catherine&rsquo;s letters from Pisa reveal an increasingly intense preoccupation with the dispute and its threat to church unity, and develop what was to become a familiar theme in her letters to secular and clerical leaders: a three-pronged program for peace in Italy and the church, consisting of the interdependent goals of Crusade, return of the pope to Rome, and ecclesiastical reform.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is particularly noteworthy about Catherine&rsquo;s letters beyond the political is that they present to us a literate community of women from the 14th century, providing material echoes of exchange between </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and other women who wrote letters to each other in absence, or to offer advice and spiritual guidance. </span><span class="c2 c0">Of her letters that survive, one-third of them were written to women, proving the significance of her relationships with women, as well as her esteem of them, as she chooses to not only address the Pope, political leaders and her confessors in her letters, but the women belonging to her order as well as those from different classes. The female community she belonged to was also significant in the propagation of her letters, as they were her first scribes. The dispersal of Catherine&rsquo;s letters therefore establishes a group of women capable of reading and writing in the vernacular and, though this was not considered to be literacy in a Latinate world, reveals the community-based education attained by these individuals. </span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">More than negotiating the various intricacies of a classed society, the letters Catherine wrote also straddled the public and private realms of her cultural context; Catherine wrote on both political and spiritual matters, often to public figures, but did so in the intimate medium of the personal letter. Letters to the Pope, Catherine must have known, would not have been read solely by him, and indeed the personal letters arrived with a public performance, as Raymond sent an accompanying messenger to Pope Gregory XI in order to interpret, </span><span class="c0 c7">viva voce</span><span class="c0">, Catherine&rsquo;s Italian words into Latin (Tylus 161). Her letters were also often written in a communal manner with fellow </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;nearby serving as her scribes, as in T204 addressed to Bartolomeo Dominici, which shows community and jocularity at once: &ldquo;Dice Alessia grassotta, che voi preghiate Dio per lei e per me, e per Cecca perditrice di tempo.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Catherine&rsquo;s acts of mediation are further embodied by the language registers she employs in the texts of the letters themselves. F. Thomas Luongo observes that Catherine (</span><span class="c0 c7">Saintly Politics</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;74) </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2 c0">mixes elements of high formality (for example, the superpapal self-identification as &ldquo;servant and slave of the servants of Jesus Christ&rdquo;) with a chatty style typical of a personal letter (for instance, the informal and simple closing, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say more,&rdquo; a typical element of Tuscan secular and mercantile letters). The tone of Catherine&rsquo;s letters is not popular or colloquial, but frequently strikes a lofty and prophetic register; nevertheless, consistent with the style of the personal letter, the language is her own Sienese vernacular, immediate and familiar, a &ldquo;low&rdquo; form of language. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through mixing registers between her opening and closing statements, Catherine shows her relative ease with negotiating a more learned rhetorical approach indicative of a public document with the features of a textual conversation between friends. Catherine mixes her serious religious guidance with &ldquo;small shreds of gossip and conversation,&rdquo; as Jane Tylus notes (33).</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Catherine works to blend orality of chattiness with a strict and consistent formality that is in keeping with her spiritual mission. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of Catherine&rsquo;s letters follow a strict formal opening that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;adhere to the literary genre of the letter, and closely follow the example of papal letters. While rhetorically positioning herself as a humble </span><span class="c0">servant in a rhetorical move on which to base her persuasion, Catherine then continues on to convey to her correspondant what she wants for them to do</span><span class="c0">. The introductory sentences of letter T236 to the nobleman Bartolo Usimbardi, for instance, exemplifies Catherine&rsquo;s practice:</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">Al nome di Ges&ugrave; Cristo crocifisso e di Maria dolce. Carissimo figliuolo in Cristo dolce Ges&ugrave;. Io Catarina, serva e schiava de&rsquo; servi di Ges&ugrave; Cristo, scrivo a voi nel prezioso sangue suo; con desiderio di vedervi ardere nella fornace della divina Carit&agrave; &hellip;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Breaking this format down, the formal openings to all her letters almost always follow this formula: </span></p><ol class="c17 lst-kix_4m3ffchvmqyp-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c8"><span class="c2 c0">Invoking Christ and sometimes Mary </span></li><li class="c1 c8"><span class="c2 c0">Referring to the addressee as her dearest son or daughter in Christ </span></li><li class="c1 c8"><span class="c2 c0">Self-referencing as the servant and slave of Christ</span></li><li class="c1 c8"><span class="c2 c0">Stating that she writes to the recipient in the precious blood of Christ </span></li><li class="c1 c8"><span class="c2 c0">Stating what she desires to see the addressee do. </span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">This trajectory enables Catherine to create hierarchies that tie both herself and the addressee to Christ and sometimes the Virgin, while also positioning herself in the dual role as both a mother to the addressee and a slave of Christ. Evoking the blood of Christ as her ink connects her letters to the common literary trope of the Middle Ages while also connoting the precious nature of her missive. By setting up these relational values, Catherine&rsquo;s request to her recipient is justified and even expected; it is as though Catherine is submitting a resume showing her qualifications prior to making demands. This careful positioning, along with her ability to comfortably write in very formal and very candid registers appropriate to each addressee reveals Catherine&rsquo;s adeptness at negotiation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though her letters are offered as personalized </span><span class="c0">correspondence typically tailored to an individual, they also provide a general spiritual value to her direct followers and even future Christians. Catherine was aware that her letters to the Pope were being read to him aloud, likely before a larger audience of his counselors and others. Moreover, she would know that items in the Pope&rsquo;s possession would enjoy a life beyond that of its owner, being of interest not just to those of his own time, but to those in the future. She knew that her letters, like other spiritual texts that circulated through churches would have been saved in church registries, especially as her reputation grew. Even in her own capacity, Catherine would sometimes tell her recipients, or messenger-scribes to share the letters with others by passing them along or reading them aloud, so that a wider audience would be able to benefit from them (Tylus 190, 201). Indeed, the major themes of her letters were often general enough to be applicable to many. As Karen Scott notes, Catherine&rsquo;s letters typically discuss a &ldquo;main virtue which she wishes her correspondents to understand and practice better&hellip;&rdquo; demonstrating that her letters can be situated in a wider spiritual discourse applicable to many (100). Her request to preserve not just her </span><span class="c0 c7">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;but her &ldquo;other writings&rdquo; as well </span><span class="c0">affirms that Catherine is aware of the textual legacy of her letters and believes that the work will continue to serve God by reaching living people.</span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c21">The Corpus of Letters and Network Analysis</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">Using digital network visualization to analyze Catherine&rsquo;s output through her extant letters renders some of the trends of her letter-writing career more obvious. Social network analysis investigates social structures, using nodes (people and things) and the ties that connect them to visualize data. In the visualization below (interactive version online), done in the statistical programming language R and the JavaScript D3 library, the nodes are comprised of letter recipients and letters, and the curved lines represent links between and among letters and their respective recipients. The nodes here are rendered as names of the recipients in text, and the letters are referred to by numbers as used in the Noffke edition of the letters. Time is also represented in this visualization, moving clockwise from the top with letter T61 and Agnesa Malavolti and the </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate </span><span class="c2 c0">(likely written before the plague of the summer of 1374), and follow through to letter T373 (written to Raymond of Capua on February 15, 1380), the break of which can be seen through the orientation of the text describing those nodes. Note that &ldquo;Raimondo da Capua&rdquo; does not appear next to letter T373, this is because recipients appear in chronological order based on the first instance that Catherine writes to them. When hovering over the name of a letter, the recipient(s) and the tie connecting the letter to the recipient(s) is rendered in a red-orange color, making it readily apparent which letters are being written to a single addressee, and which are addressed to a non-collective group. When hovering over the name of a recipient, the relevant letters addressed to him or her are displayed in a violet color, immediately displaying how many letters that recipient received, and whether the letters were clustered throughout Catherine&rsquo;s letter-writing activity or if they were limited to a particular time period. </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 382.00px; height: 382.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image00.png" style="width: 382.00px; height: 382.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Fig. 5.

Though one would expect Catherine&rsquo;s confessor, Raymond of Capua, to play a significant role throughout her letter production (and we do have 16 extant letters addressed to him), a lot of activity can be seen with respect to some other recipients: Monna </span><span class="c0">Agnesa</span><span class="c0">, wife of the Florentine tailor Francesco di Pipino (and with whom she shares some addressed letters); Bartolomeo Dominici, a Dominican friar, sometimes confessor, travel companion, and who provides a testimony in the </span><span class="c0 c7">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c0">; Neri di Landoccio Pagliaresi, a Sienese nobleman and poet, disciple, scribe, and eventual hermit, who was responsible for the earliest gathering and dissemination of Catherine&rsquo;s correspondence. Clustering around the times when they served as pope, Gregory XI received 14 extant letters between </span><span class="c0">1375</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;and 1377, showing the extent of Catherine&rsquo;s work to bring him back to Rome, with about 70% of the extant letters sent prior to his decision to return. Pope Urban VI received eight extant letters between 1378 and 1380, revealing a continued literary-based outreach and spirituality on Catherine&rsquo;s part after her great achievement of convincing Gregory XI to return to Rome. The Queen of Naples, Giovanna d&rsquo;Angi&ograve;, received seven extant letters between late 1374 and 1380, exemplifying Catherine&rsquo;s political involvement that persisted throughout, and likely drove her letter writing career at least in part. </span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 559.00px; height: 615.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image04.png" style="width: 559.00px; height: 615.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Fig. 6.

The dark blue group at the top are the lay people in her network, including figures like Niccol&ograve; di Toldi, who she comforted during his execution, and the tailor Francesco di Pipino and his wife Agnesa from Pisa. Moving clockwise, the pink nodes are part of a family cluster, and the purple nodes are part of a </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cluster, both of which include the orange node of Lapa, Catherine&rsquo;s mother who was both a biological family member and later became a member of Catherine&rsquo;s order. The green cluster shows the members of the nobility that Catherine had interactions with, along with three orange nodes that were both nobles and </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate</span><span class="c0">: Alessa dei Saracini, Francesca di Clemente Gori, Agnesa di Orso Malevolti. These three women, who were educated as members of the nobility, were instrumental to Catherine&rsquo;s learning to read and write. Though the network of nobles that Catherine had connections with was not as large as the lay or religious networks, it is clear that they are still a numerous group, and the overlap with the </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;show how close some of the members in this group were to Catherine. Between the nobility on the bottom right and the orange cluster of the religious on the bottom left are some more overlaps, including Giovanni della Celle, a Benedictine priest at Vallombrosa, and </span><span class="c0">Tora di Piero Gambacorta</span><span class="c0">, a Dominican </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;who accompanied Catherine to Avignon. Another hybrid node, </span><span class="c2 c0">Francesco di Messer Vanni Malavolti, is rendered in green because he was a nobleman during Catherine&rsquo;s life and became a Benedictine later, showing how Catherine&rsquo;s persuasiveness continued to resonate with those in her network even after her death. The light green group is comprised of the religious hermits that Catherine interacted with, all Augustinian from the community in Lecceto, including the Englishman William Flete. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter recipients are also visualized by group and sex in two states of the interactive diagram below:</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 426.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image09.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 426.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Fig. 7.

Her husband who was also included as an addressee with Agnesa, received 11 total. The person who received the most letters, as one may expect, was Catherine&rsquo;s confessor Raymond, who was the recipient of 16 letters total. In terms of total number of letters, Pope Gregory XI received the second-most highest number of letters, having received 14 from Catherine. With the diagram divided by groups, we can see that the religious group received the most letters, with lay and noble more equal in distribution.

Catherine also enjoyed network connections to other professionals such as lawyers, lecturers and notaries, and even enjoyed the company of the poets Giannozzo di Benci Sacchetti and Neri di Landoccio Pagliaresi.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final visualization shows Catherine&rsquo;s letter activity over time to three groups: religious, noble, and lay. Over the course of the period of Catherine&rsquo;s letter-writing career, spanning from 1374 through 1380 (the year of her death), we see the amount of letters proliferate between the years of 1377 and 1379. The dip in letters in 1376 is the year that Catherine traveled as ambassador to Avignon. Catherine only wrote five letters in 1380; two to Pope Urban VI, and three to Raymond of Capua, with the last two dated February 15, a few months before Catherine died on April 29.&nbsp;What is particularly interesting is that the letters to the nobility continue to increase over time until 1380, with three letters written to noblemen in 1374, nine in 1375, ten in 1376, 13 in 1377, 26 in 1378, and 34 in 1379. This suggests that Catherine has a greater need to write to these connections as she becomes more politically involved and needs greater support in terms of powerful interlocutors and perhaps financial backing. It also suggests that she was able to build her network of these well-connected individuals as her reputation grew. </span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 422.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image01.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 422.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Fig. 10.

The community-building nature of Catherine&rsquo;s outreach and expression of religiosity are evidenced in the archive of letters that we have extant today. Of the nearly 400 letters that remain, 46.2% of the letters were addressed to more than one recipient. That is, for almost half of the letters that Catherine wrote, she intended more than one recipient, whether it was a group of the </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate</span><span class="c0">, a Sienese political group, or a husband and wife (as with the letters addressed to Francesco di Pipino and Monna Agnesa). By writing to the plural </span><span class="c0 c7">voi</span><span class="c2 c0">, Catherine is consciously spreading her writing, connecting with many more recipients and getting more value and potential outreach for a single letter. Though there are some instances when she writes similar letters to different recipients (as when she writes to people she does not know well), she is more often writing to recipients who are already connected to each other, tapping into a community that connects through and radiates around her. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 593.81px; height: 365.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image06.png" style="width: 813.12px; height: 365.50px; margin-left: -219.32px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c2 c0">Fig. 11. Pie Chart of Single Letter Recipients vs. Group Letter Recipients</span></p><p class="c1 c10 c11"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c2 c0">Indeed, Catherine works to further develop this community as the majority (73.7%) of her correspondents are the recipients of more than one letter over the course of her letter writing career. The remaining 26.3% of her extant letters are written to recipients who only received one known letter from Catherine, which in many cases is indicative of a one-off requirement of Catherine&rsquo;s, as when she wrote to a prostitute from Perugia on behalf of the prostitute&rsquo;s brother (T276). In other cases the recipients may have in fact received more than one letter but they are no longer extant. This is likely the case in letter T151b, which is no longer decipherable beyond the title of &ldquo;Frate&rdquo; for its having been overwritten so much. The overwriting is, however, indicative of a continued literary engagement with Catherine&rsquo;s texts, as people continue to interact with these physical objects that were collected and maintained to testify to Catherine&rsquo;s spirituality as well as her productive writing career. With all of this in mind, when considering the circular flare network diagram, it is important to realize that it is Catherine of Siena who is at the center of this network, serving as the connecting force among all of these recipients and letters.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 519.15px; height: 334.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image05.png" style="width: 744.16px; height: 334.50px; margin-left: -225.01px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c0">Fig. 12.

Alessa dei Saracini, a young woman of a noble family who took the habit of Saint Dominic, served as a travel companion to Catherine and also offered her house in Siena as a place of refuge for her outside of the crowded Benincasa household. As a noblewoman, Alessa was educated at least in the vernacular language, and taught Catherine to read Italian (</span><span class="c0">Noffke</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c7">Vision Through A Distant Eye</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;40). These women, including other female recipients of letters, are indicative of a female literacy throughout Italy and beyond, and also point to a literary network of women in the vernacular language. Though many of these women likely did not read and write in Latin due to their being precluded from masculine discourse, they were still capable at creating this broader community of written discourse and exchange in Italian.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 592.50px; height: 383.15px;"><img alt="" src="images/image03.png" style="width: 859.69px; height: 383.15px; margin-left: -267.19px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c2 c0">Fig. 13.

This is likely due to women&rsquo;s lack of access to education, but also speaks to Catherine&rsquo;s ability to penetrate the more exclusive masculine religious community of her time, and how she did so through adept written exchange. During a time when the vast majority of Italian spiritual women were considered to be &ldquo;witches&rdquo; or otherwise transgressive in some way, Catherine was able to persuasively and successfully advocate for her authentic mystical experiences and knowledge of God (King </span><span class="c0">145</span><span class="c0 c2">). </span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">An instrumental figure in asserting and maintaining Catherine&rsquo;s reception and legacy was her confessor and advisor from 1374 on, Raymond of Capua (Raimondo della Vigne da Capua). Destined for a legal career and student of law at the University of Bologna, Raymond instead chose to enter into the Dominican Order while still a student in 1350. First assigned to Montepulciano, he served as chaplain to nuns of the Dominican Second Order in the monastery there. Agnes of Montepulciano, a former prioress of this monastery, was highly regarded by the community, and Raymond became her first biographer when he wrote of her life about 50 years after her death. Clearly, as someone educated in law and someone who was writing hagiography even before his encounter with Catherine, Raymond was a person who realized the power of writing. And in fact this early writing did eventually prove to be fruitful as Agnes was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726. Raymond was sent next to Rome and then to Siena, where the Master General assigned him to be the spiritual director and confessor to Catherine of Siena, who was already a notable figure by the time Raymond began to work with her, and she in turn helped his career by causing him to be noticed by the pope. Because of his important relationship to her, Raymond received a large amount of letters from Catherine, including letters that describe important turning points in her life, such as when she describes learning to write by her own hand (T272), and when she recounts the execution of Perugian Niccol&ograve; di Toldo in 1375 (T273). Becoming the Master General of the Dominican Order in the year of Catherine&rsquo;s death, he worked on the authoritative </span><span class="c0 c7">viva</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of her life between 1385 and 1395. The result of this work, a hagiographical text that is known as the </span><span class="c0 c7">Legenda maior</span><span class="c2 c0">, would establish itself as the most influential biographical narrative on Catherine.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">Among her male scribes were her disciples Francesco di Messer Vanni Malavolti, Neri di Landoccio Pagliaresi and Stefano di Corrado Maconi. Francesco, who was first a married nobleman then became a Benedictine, received only one extant letter of Catherine&rsquo;s. He provided testimony for the </span><span class="c0 c7">Processo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c7">Castellano</span><span class="c0">, a document compiled in the beginning of the 15th century and which proved to be instrumental to the canonization of Catherine. Neri, as discussed above, received many of Catherine&rsquo;s letters, and was an important correspondent for Catherine as he helped to secure her literary legacy through collecting and disseminating a group of her letters. Stefano was also responsible for a collection of Catherine&rsquo;s letters. A member of the lesser nobility of Siena and a travel companion, like Francesco he also provided one of the 24 testimonies to the </span><span class="c0 c7">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c2 c0">, and entered the Carthusian Order after Catherine&rsquo;s death. With two scribes among the men who collected Catherine&rsquo;s letters for posterity, as well as two who bore witness to her saintly acts, it is clear that her scribes greatly respected Catherine&rsquo;s good works and writing, honoring the latter through maintaining and circulating it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the other correspondents of hers who provided testimony for the </span><span class="c0 c7">Processo Castellano</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are Bartolomeo Dominici, a Dominican friar, sometimes confessor and travel companion who received nine extant letters from Catherine; Martino, Abbot of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Michele in Passignano, who received two extant letters; Pietro di Giovanni Ventura, an early disciple who was converted by Catherine to become a Dominican friar and served as Catherine&rsquo;s emissary and also received two extant letters. Tommaso d&rsquo;Antonio da Siena, also known as Caffarini, was a very important figure in Catherine&rsquo;s life and her afterlife. Responsible for beginning work on the </span><span class="c0 c7">Processo Castellano </span><span class="c0">through the solicitation of testimonies, and providing a testimony himself, Caffarini also campaigned to seek papal approval of the Dominican </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and worked to develop and legitimize the saintly cult around Catherine of Siena (Ferzoco </span><span class="c0">187</span><span class="c0">). A native of Siena, devoted follower of Catherine, and the director of the Sienese </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the year of her death, Caffarini proved to be extremely influential in promoting reform within the Dominican order, receiving recognition for the </span><span class="c0 c7">mantellate</span><span class="c0">, cultivating Catherine&rsquo;s cult and verifying her sanctity (</span><span class="c0">Parsons</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;16). Together with Raymond of Capua, Caffarini is responsible for much of the hagiographical writing about Catherine in the decades after her death. Creating an abbreviated version of Raymond&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c7">Legenda maior</span><span class="c0">, called the </span><span class="c0 c7">Legenda minor</span><span class="c0">, Caffarini would go on to write the much longer </span><span class="c0 c7">Libellus de Supplemento</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;to include additional biographical as well as hagiographical details about Catherine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cristofano di Gano Guidini, a follower of Catherine&rsquo;s who did not fully commit to a religious life, choosing instead to marry and have children, served sometimes as a scribe for Catherine, according to Caffarini, and most importantly rendered her </span><span class="c0 c7">Dialogo </span><span class="c0">into the Latin text that would be used in the Middle English translation the </span><span class="c0 c7">Orchard of Syon</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Luongo, </span><span class="c0 c7">Saintly Politics</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;136). A Sienese notary who was active in politics, Cristofano was aware of what was required to gain legitimacy through textual distribution in contemporary Europe. Though Catherine exercised control over her texts through use of the Sienese vernacular, Cristofano and Raymond &mdash; who wrote his </span><span class="c0 c7">Legenda maior</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in Latin &mdash; and more than likely Catherine herself, realized that Latin translation would be necessary to realize true circulation of her writing. Were it not for this Latin translation by the notary Cristofano, who was also a writer of his own autobiography, the </span><span class="c0 c7">Libro di memorie</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;which includes vivid recounts of his relationship with Catherine, the </span><span class="c0 c7">Dialogo </span><span class="c0">likely would not have been later translated into Middle English for the nuns of the Syon Abbey. Though Catherine would always assert that spiritual priorities were more important ones, including in her letters to Cristofano, she likely understood that his political involvement was an important node of her larger network, and his spirituality proved to be more civic in nature, particularly in his devotion to the Spedale della Scala. Indeed, F. Thomas Luongo reads Catherine&rsquo;s tone in her letters to him not necessarily as reproachful, but suggests that it is only &ldquo;affectionate mocking of a follower whom she knew to be committed only so far&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0 c7">Saintly Politics </span><span class="c2 c0">137). I believe that it is Cristofano&rsquo;s &ldquo;civic piety,&rdquo; as Luongo calls it, which leads to Cristofano taking action with the translation of Catherine&rsquo;s book, as he ensures that the educated elite and those with political power can read it and take it seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine, however, also exerted her own power over the afterlife of her texts, by entrusting her writing into the hands of Giovanni Tantucci, one of her early followers. A priest and scholar, likely educated at Cambridge along with William Flete, Giovanni was convinced by Catherine to &ldquo;renounce his comfortable worldly life as a priest and dedicate himself to the ascetic life&rdquo; as early as 1365 (Russell 79). He became part of the Augustinian hermit community of </span><span class="c0">Lecceto</span><span class="c0">, and Catherine probably was provided access to this network through Giovanni. She would continue to correspond with this network frequently throughout her letter writing career (</span><span class="c0">Jorgensen</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;146). Because of this long history, and likely because of his scholastic approach to religiosity, she had a great deal of respect for him and she entrusted him with her writings including her letters before her death (Noffke, &ldquo;The Writings of Catherine of Siena&rdquo; 333). He absolved her on her deathbed, and also delivered her eulogy. While Caffarini suggests that he was at a loss for words, his taking on the duties of her absolution and funerary oration indicates that he took care of her afterlife in every sense of the word, including of her work. </span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0">In her last letter, written to Raymond, Catherine entrusts the </span><span class="c0 c7">Dialogo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in particular to four men; the addressee along with Bartolomeo de&rsquo; Dominici, Tommaso della Fonte and the &ldquo;Master&rdquo; Giovanni Tantucci (</span><span class="c0">T373</span><span class="c2 c0">):</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">Anco vi prego che il libro e ogni scrittura la quale trovaste di me, voi e frate Bartolomeo e frate Tomaso e il Maestro, ve le rechiate per le mani; e fatene quello che vedete che sia pi&ugrave; onore di Dio, con missere Tomaso insieme: nel quale io trovava alcuna recreazione.

This letter, explicitly dated February 15, 1380 in three manuscripts, is very likely her last dictated letter, written the same day as T371, which was also written to Raymond, but done in her own hand. What I would like to highlight here is that for Catherine her writing and her greater community are thought about nearly simultaneously &mdash; for her, this is her legacy, and she cares about what happens to both her writing and her </span><span class="c0 c7">famiglia</span><span class="c0">. In requesting that several of her followers be responsible for her book and whatever other writing they can find, she ensures that there are several guardians to keep track of her archives. She has found &ldquo;recreazione&rdquo; in them, from the Latin &ldquo;recreare&rdquo; as in &ldquo;create again, renew,&rdquo; which would have been used similarly in Old French. In Middle English, &ldquo;recreation&rdquo; was more indicative of &ldquo;mental or spiritual consolation.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Italian etymology shows that </span><span class="c0 c7">ricreare</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;deals with a sense of &ldquo;rianimare&rdquo; alongside rebuilding and restoration, but also with the joy that comes after the strain of rebuilding: &ldquo;ogni sorta di piacevolezze per distrarre l&rsquo;animo.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c0"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;If we think of her writing as a re-creation, it speaks to the reforms that she began to make in the Dominican Order as well as in her special kind of spirituality that engages with the community through good works and writing, and it can also speak to the reflection and the pleasure that can be found after doing this work. Together with her greater network, her </span><span class="c0 c7">famiglia</span><span class="c2 c0">, Catherine is able to spread the commitment to reform as well as the joy that can be found in recreating. </span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c10"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><div><p class="c10 c19"><span class="c2 c18"></span></p></div><hr class="c20"><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;Noffke has the total number of letters in the volumes as 220, with 81 letters in the first volume and 139 in the second (318); Luongo has the total number as 223 letters and does not offer a breakdown by volume (153).

She had influenced common folk and politicians, clergy and hierarchy, by her words and by the power of her life&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c7 c12">Vision Through A Distant Eye</span><span class="c12">, </span><span class="c2 c4">63). </span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt3">[3]</a><span class="c12">&nbsp;&ldquo;There are a number of possible levels at which alterations could have entered into the text of the letters: at the initial dictation, in the making of original or dictation copy for a collection, and finally in any later transcription from collection to collection. But at each of these levels we are dealing with scribes who, as devotees of Catherine, had every reason to be as faithful as possible to the </span><span class="c12 c7">sense</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;of their text if not always to the minor peculiarities of its expression (e.g., orthography and grammar)&rdquo; (Noffke, </span><span class="c12 c7">Letters</span><span class="c2 c4">, xxiii). </span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref4" id="ftnt4">[4]</a><span class="c12">&nbsp;At length, Noffke has this to say about the authenticity of the letters: &ldquo;Both in these originals and in the letters which have survived only through later transcription and editions, minor differences from letter to letter and frequent suppression of Sienese dialectal forms would indicate some influence of the individual scribes&rsquo; backgrounds on what each transcribed. It would be surprising if this were not true, given the scribes&rsquo; linguistic, cultural and professional diversity and the speed at which Catherine was accustomed to dictate. Overall consistency in style and in conceptual development, however, make it certain that in substance the wording is Catherine&rsquo;s own &mdash; especially since the tenures of the various scribes and the nature of the first manuscript collections precludes any effort on their part to create a unified style, whether by collusion or by an individual scribe. In addition, her scribes&rsquo; veneration for this woman they called </span><span class="c12 c7">mamma</span><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;would hardly have been compatible with their doing any conscious violence to her though. Linguistic analysis has in fact established that, other than for very minor details of grammar and orthography, the language of the letters is indeed Catherine&rsquo;s&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Writings of Catherine of Siena&rdquo; 297-8).</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref5" id="ftnt5">[5]</a><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;Fat Alessa says that you are praying for her and asks you please to keep praying for her.
